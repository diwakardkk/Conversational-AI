"Just got an ativan prescription! How to balance feeling tired/Caffeine? I have a psych eval coming up in January, but got a script for Ativan to last me at least until then. Success. 

The thing is, I'm already exhausted from the lack of sleep and panic attacks. I'm sure that taking this for a few days will help me get back on track, but I really don't want to be a sleepy zombie. My ideal state would be to have improved focus from my usual anxious/exhausted cycles. 

Does anyone know the effects of mixing Ativan with caffeine? Are they interacting neurologically with the same chemicals, potentially cancelling one another out? Can I take Ativan to chill my anxiety, and caffeine for alertness, and have them be complementary?

**Edit:** While waiting for responses here I did some research. Turns out both lorazepam and caffeine affect the GABA neurotransmitters. Caffeine inhibits GABA release and causes more nerve transmissions, while lorazepam enhances the effects of GABA. So even though they aren't having an exact opposite effect, it really is a balancing game.

"DAE experience ""Work place"" anxiety? Don't know if that's even a thing, but I find that I'm a completely different person at work. I get a knot in my stomach when I walk thru the doors, and get so nervous when talking to anyone who is higher up than me. It's like sometimes I can't even get words out when speaking to someone bc I am so anxious.  Sometimes I'll say stuff that's out of character for me and I'm like ""wtf did I just say?, that makes 0 sense"".  

When I leave work for the day, I find myself sitting in silence on the ride home thinking about everything that happened at work that day, everything that I said, etc. Its like a continuous loop of wondering what my bosses think of me. Also, this anxious feeling I have while at work feels like it hurts my performance. Sometimes my memory is clouded and I have trouble remembering things because I'm so wound up during the day. I stress myself out so much worrying about my perception at work. 

Sorry for the long post. Pretty new to Reddit and this is my first post. Also want to mention that I have been diagnosed with OCC & GAD and take meds for both, but they don't seem to really work.

"My newfound anxiety and social awkwardness story (posted to r/socialanxiety 
At my past summer job i expierienced a continuous awkward situation for the full duration of my summer break. 

I came to the first day of training with my friend who recommended the job for me (i have no idea why or why i agreed) and i found that my other coworkers consisted of people i have never met before and people from my high school that i kind of knew but never talked to. 

Once i sat down and our new boss came to meet us, i proceeded to not say a single word to anyone for the whole duration of the meeting. I surprised myself because nothing like this usually happened to me in the past. 

I thought that maybe that day was not my day and i would come back the next day and actually start to connect with my coworkers.

The next day came and the same thing happened. Then the next week came, then the next month, and i still failed to have a single full conversation with any of my coworkers. During lunch breaks everyone would sit together and talk with eachother, but i ended up going off-site during every lunch break to avoid sitting in awkward silence around everyone else. I even grew more and more distant from my coworkers and even distanced myself from my friend who reccomended me the job in the first place (who initially i was close to before this summer job). 

As the summer went on, i would intentionally come late to work to miss out on the morning meetings to avoid more awkward interactions. When my coworkers would make plans after work to get food together i would either say i was busy with some made up excuse or i would just not show up completely. 

I contemplated quitting throughout the whole summer but i couldn't bring myself to confronting my boss with a made up reason to leave, so i ended up sticking through for the most degrading  awkward summer of my life. Even on the last day of the job while everyone was saying their goodbyes to each other, i would just say a quick ""bye guys"" and slip off from everyone else.

Overall, taking that job was one of my biggest regrets. Just had to get it off my chest. Its been 3 months and I still feel like crap. Anyone have any stories/solutions?

"Anyone suffer from selective mutism as a child? As a child I was diagnosed with selective mutism. Apart from my family I wouldn't talk to anyone. Because of this I had little to no social circle and from preschool and all throughout elementary I was granted S.E.A at full-time in the classroom to aid me in communicating/functioning with not only my classmates but the teacher as well, i struggled severely. This persisted from the time I was very little just up until the end of elementary school. Entering 8th or 9th grade I was more capable of talking but still very hesitant to do so. The last few years of high school were much easier and now I just seem to struggle with extreme social anxiety as well as increased general anxiety.

Like every fiber of my being is being stretched so thin the threads will tear and I'll spontaneously combust. Other times I can't feel my limbs.

"I think too much about health condition I have Hello everyone, I struggle with anxiety disorder, neurasthenia for about 5 months. (Got diagnosed yesterday) 
My doctor says I'm fine, it's just stress, but I just can't get rid of thoughts that I've got some kind of mental disorder and anxiety disorder is just a first step into going full crazy (schizophrenia, personality disorder).
Last week I have my first psychologist consultation. I talked about everything, about my family relationship, my child illness (I had serious hip disease, spent almost all childhood in hospitals), about every aspect of my overthinking, etc. The next day I felt so exhausted, for two next days I've been thinking that something wrong with me, since my childhood wasn't sunny at all, and that bag of bad thoughts will never dissaper.
Every time I hear word psycho... I have goosebumps and panic begins. Also my life full of stress atm, exams, got call into army (atm trying to find a desease that will help me get rid of army enrollment, thinking about having some kind of disease also not helping at all). 
I've read several books and articles on anxiety treating (I find ""Panic Away"" book really helpful, you can download it for free). 
Right now I'm working on acceptance of my anxiety and trying to stick with breathing exercises. It helps, but sometimes everything is out of control. 
Also, today is my first day on medication (idk, probably it helps), my doctor prescribed me phenibut pills (I'm from Russia). 

Socal support really helps, my friend trying to help me as much as she can. But I'm also getting nervous about that she'll get tired of that shit and also I don't want her to get anxious because of me. 

Idk, my thoughts kinda not structed, sorry for that and also my bad grammar. 

The last thing I want to say, that I belive Im not alone, and we all gonna overcome this. We will get back to the old calm life, full of joy and happiness.

"What to do about situation I'm in regarding arachnophobia So while not diagnosed, I can get very anxious about two main things: my health (where I have some sort of pain/issue/ptsd from past sickness) and spiders. I seriously can't handle them.

The problem is I just moved into to this new place for college, and I signed a lease with 2 others without seeing it in person. There are 3 floors and I got the basement, but I thought it was completely built cuz the pics only showed one area of it. 

I get here and the entire basement is unfinished other than the corner where my bedroom is, and there are a ton of spiders, Beatles, etc.. The foundation is open outside of my bedroom, there are unoccupied/abandoned unfinished rooms down here too, as well as all the electrical and heating stuff. Point is, there are crevices everywhere, the roof is low, and it's an old house. Basically a larger crawl space /garage/tool shed lookin thing.

Every time I use a spray for spiders a ton more just come running out of nearby locations and it's making me super anxious about living here. 

I can't stop looking and examining all over, always finding new places they are at, dead or alive. I'm not sure if I should just stick with it or what, and I'm worried it will only get worse when babies hatch or the seasons change. 


I feel fine after a while, but the second I find something I panic and just feel bad for a good 30 minutes. I'm like OCD about finding them and making sure I'm ok and idk what to do, I feel like my room is somewhere I should feel safe and relaxed in the world.

"Breaking through the fog - there is hope I want to give you a little hope. I went to a dark place three years ago. Feeling like I was constantly falling, foggy, fear of the worst, migraines, thinking I had brain damage, always scared. I felt broken. But I took it one day at a time. I saw a psychiatrist, and he gave me some medicine and it took a lot of trial and error to find the right one, but we did. And I slowly got better. It took time, but the brain is an amazing organ. It will heal. 

I would have one day out of the fog, and then get pulled back in. Then a week later I would pull out for three days and get sucked back in. and two weeks later just have one day out. I didn't want to talk to anyone, and I felt so weird. But I pushed and pushed, and I haven't felt the fog in months. Just have faith, you are stronger than you think. 

If there is one thing I can suggest it's see a psychiatrist. I have multiple degrees and work in a specialized field, and it has never hurt me in any way professionally. I didn't work for a year when it all happened, so don't get down on yourself. There is hope, I promise. ",Anxiety

"Finding it hard to cope at the moment with ""future worry"" Hi everyone! I have a pretty heavy load of things at the moment and I'm really struggling to deal with it. November is our busiest month at work and we are not supposed to take any leave, my grandma probably won't live out the year, I live on the opposite side of the country and will be having surgery before Christmas but don't have dates yet.


Having to take time off work is a really big anxiety trigger for me, my brain is focused on the possibility that I'm going to have to take a few weeks off in November to have my surgery and in that time grandma is going to die and I won't be able to go back for the funeral to grieve with my family.


I'm having a really hard time trying to cope with this, I'm having more frequent panic attacks and my normal coping mechanisms aren't helping because it's all things that are reasonable to be upset about, at least in my thinking.


I've found myself thinking that it would be easier if grandma had already passed because I would be able to deal with that instead of just waiting for this awful thing to inevitably happen. That and she's suffering, I wouldn't let a pet suffer like that why should she have to? Then I feel like a terrible person for thinking that way, even though I've spoken to other family members that feel the same way. I think when I have my surgery dates it will be a bit easier because then I can sort things out with work but it still raises the concern I might not be able to go back for the funeral when it happens.


I have no idea how to not worry about this kind of stuff. I know that it's all GOING to happen but how do you deal with the waiting? I keep randomly bursting into tears and then turns into panic attacks because I'm crying and the pattern continues. I don't know how to find a way out, I'm trying to accept what is and will happen but at the same time I'm a very emotionally sensitive person and it  just feels like everything is too much at the moment.

My heart isnt in dire condition so i will live if i only take one pill a day until i get this figured out.. i just dont want to think like this and get that flight or fight responce every time i take my full days worth of medicine.

"The irritability that comes with anxiety is ruining my life My anxiety is at fever pitch lately and it presents so much as anger and irritability.  I don't want to talk to anyone.  When I go to stores I put in ear buds and turn on an audiobook and get really upset when people try to engage with me. I anger so easily.  Was trying to deal with someone at the doctor's office and my heart rate felt like it was going to explode on me.

I'm doing everything I can.  I'm being active and trying to eat better.  I'm trying to consciously be overnice to everyone.  Breathing exercises, meditation, writing.  I've resorted to isolating a bit so that I can limit the destruction.  None of this is sustainable.

A new emotion I can add to my collection of two now. I realize, logically, it's not real danger so why is it I still chose to be anxious? Maybe it's the chemical imbalance in the brain but I also believe that if your environment can cause you depression/anxiety your way of thinking can get you out of it.

"Does anyone else experience this? So my anxiety started around this time last year. I would get high on weed, which is something i did way before the anxiety started. Something changed though and it started making me anxious. The weed would make me start questioning reality, as well as make me anxious for death. It's impossible to know when you will go, and the uncertainty kills me (no pun intended). So I stop smoking weed, and have slowly been getting better over the last year. I still have random thoughts, and attacks, but they are much better. Here is where my problem comes in:

I used to work out A LOT. 6 days a week, sometimes twice a day. I stopped about 6 months before my anxiety occurred. I figure that it could have something to do with how I stopped working out completely. When I work out now, I get the high that accompanies the post work out, but even that high makes me anxious now. Does a post-work out high bother anyone else? I am getting better at managing it, and I am aware that this is something that is necessary as opposed to mary-jane. Part of the anxiety comes from a feeling I get in my face. The upper left side of my face feels numb/limp almost as though I am having a stroke, but other than that there is nothing. The feeling my body gets after the work out messes with me though, and the feeling I get in my face does not help much.

"Anyone have suggestions to help get back to exercising without having palpitations or anxiety attacks? u/tlino

Hey Reddit.

I've been on meds for my anxiety for a few months and after adjusting my dosage I'm fairly evened out throughout the day. The big problem is when I exercise. I took a while off from exercising after I ran one day and had a insanely overwhelming attack after I stopped. That was what kicked my frequency of attacks up and then I went to my doctor. I work out occasionally, but if I do kickboxing, jogging, or anything that really spikes my heart rate my heart pounds really hard and potentially end up having an attack. I assume some of the problem is how inactive I've been compared to how I was before. If anyone has had this problem and figured out a way to help get back into their old routine I'd appreciate the help. It drives me insane knowing exercise helps anxiety, but I potentially will have an anxiety attack if I press a little too hard. Thanks in advance for any advice.

"New job. Severe anxiety. Prescribed Zoloft. Long post:  
For the past 7 years, I've been substitute teaching and absolutely love it. I couldn't wait for the day when I secured an actual teaching job.  
This past February, I was called to schedule an interview for a teaching term and panic rose up in me. I was constantly worrying, lost my appetite, frequent trips to the bathroom, etc. This is a job I wanted to a long time but the thought of actually starting scared me stupid. There were times where I felt that I'd rather be hit by a bus than start this job. I though of reasons why I could turn the job down, etc. Basically, panic and fear were gripping me.  
When I found out that I didn't get the job, I was disappointed but all of those anxiety feelings instantly disappeared.  
Fast forward to now: I actually got offered a term teaching position which I accepted and all those same feelings have returned. Feeling fearful and inadequate, upset stomach, diarrhea, nausea. Constantly thinking about the job and what could go wrong.  
Normally, I love to spend time with my girls, and read in the evenings, but I find myself unable to enjoy those things because my mind is constantly thinking of the new job.  
I've been waking up with what feels like a racing heartbeat and small shakes. Evenings seem to be much better but I've been feeling really poor in the mornings/early afternoon.  
Yesterday I spoke with a doctor. He asked a ton of questions and suspects that I have general anxiety disorder and depression. He prescribed me Zoloft (sertraline) 25mg a day for the first week, then 50mg a day after that. He also prescribed me 0.5mg Ativan (lorazepam) to use as needed.  
If there is anyone here who has been in a similar position, I'd love to hear from you. Anyone here taking Zoloft (sertraline), how did it improve your anxiety, if at all. Basically, anyone who feels like they can help me/reassure me, that would be great.",Anxiety
"Doctors and anxiety symptoms I go to the doctor a fairly average amount, maybe a visit or 2 above the norm. However, I and other family members have noticed that he's labeled our entire family as hypochondriacs (he even said this to my Dad).

Now, I know that sometimes my issues are anxiety related, but some could be very serious and I won't know if it's real or in my head until the doctor has tested for a cause. For example, when I had mono he said I'm just anxious. Only got diagnosed when I went to the hospital. 

Do I need a new doctor or am I just overly paranoid? I can't spend all of my money on doctors visits only for him to chalk it up to anxiety without running test. He even told my Dad (who doesn't have anxiety), without running any test, that if his chest pain was cancer he'd be dead, instead of finding a cause.

 The anticipation triggers my anxiety and it's hard for me to calm down my body's flight or fight reactions. I feel like the more I try to control it with tools and techniques the more I am triggered.

"Recently my doctor upped my SSRI dosage, need advice I've been on 20mg citalopram for two months now. I can feel I'm on the road to recovery but I know I'm not there yet. feeling a lot better about my situation. But I rang my doctor to get my tablets as i was running out and she said that because I'm not feeling 100% better at two months in I need to have my dosage increased to 30mg citalopram. 
Does anyone have any thoughts on this? Should I keep doing  the same dosage or listen to my doctor? They've given me a box of 20mg and a 10mg box so I could keep my regular dose going and not tell them. I really don't know what to do 20mg side effects are bad enough already ",Anxiety

Basically I've had really bad anxiety for years (and depression which is a different story) my doctor prescribed me prozac for it and now I keep having huge physical panic attacks that are lasting hours. Also, as soon as I touch alcohol I start having panic attacks (used to be an alcoholic) I want some Diazepam from my doctor so I can immediately get rid of the panic attacks as soon as they start, but beings as it's the UK I keep getting put on other antidepressants instead which is what started giving me panic attacks in the first place.

"Don't post on here much because I always feel I get my anxiety under control. But lately... 30M here,

Without boring you with my life's story I'll do a quick synopsis: I went almost a full year without any anxiety. I felt on top of the world, wound up falling in love with a co-worker, asked her out, over the next  few months she kept sending mixed signals, stringing me along before blatantly ignoring me and blowing me off. Which triggered the worst bouts of anxiety I've ever had.

I had a handle on it the last few weeks, felt more in control of my feelings and was moving forward. But seeing her at work usually sets off a minor bit of anxiety and put me in a relatively poor mood. It's really just heartbreak that she (someone I called a good friend) can so coldly toss me aside like I was nothing.

Next, there was a new girl that started at work (I'm sure you see a trend, but I don't have much of a social circle lol) this girl is absolutely stunning and cute as a button. She's a cosplayer and she's a gamer and super nerdy. All things I love. Her and I started chatting quite a bit, and I thought ""maybe. Though unlikely."" the more time passed, and the more my feelings for the previous girl turned, I thought maybe I should ask this girl out (I discovered she was single in a semi-subtle way) and so I started to formulate the best way to go about asking her out...then perfect timing today she changes her  FB status to in a relationship.
Even though I mentally prepared myself for the likelihood she wasn't interested and so on...the feeling of anxiety, hurt and loneliness just bubbled right to the surface and I'm really having  a hard time moving passed it and people at work are noticing a distinct change in my demeanor.",Anxiety

How the hell am I supposed to get a job when this happens??? I have a shit ton of friends and non of them think I have this problem because I appear so cool and confident when I'm not in a situation where anything is expected of me but for some reason when it's anything school or job related I just completely lose it....

"Does anyone else's anxiety skyrocket when playing video games? So first of all I want to say I am absolutely not sure if this is the right subreddit or if this is my anxiety causing this or what, but I'm tired of dealing with this :( I felt the OCD subreddit isn't good, since this might be considered asking for medical advice. If you have any suggestions on where this could belong better, please tell me and I will remove this post and take it where it belongs!

(It's not just video games that make me feel like this, I also have similar problems regarding watching YouTube videos, reading books, watching movies, etc.)

Whenever I try to relax by playing, I feel obliged to play 100% to the point where I cannot enjoy the game anymore. For example if I was playing Skyrim, I need to read every book and note, hear every voice line an NPC can say, visit every single house, steal every single item worth something, find and search every location marked or not... the list goes on and on. Or playing Elder Scrolls online, I spend hours going through NPC merchants trying to hear every boring voice line they have. 

So to put it shortly, a few years back I had hundreds and hundreds of hours put into games. Now, I open the game, maybe play through the tutorial in my own meticulous way.. and then quit because I feel so anxious about not doing everything perfectly. The only game I have managed to complete in the past year has been Assassin's Creed Syndicate, and I have been playing Overwatch a lot but I have over a 1000 hours on it and it is getting fairly tiring sometimes. I have tried online games, RPGs, all kinds of stuff. I can't even play the Sims without panicking.

I've tried to talk to a lot of different people about this, and no one seems to understand me. Sometimes I find a person who says they have ""gaming OCD"", and get truly disappointed when I learn it's really nothing at all and they still very much enjoy their games. My boyfriend tries to often buy me new games to keep me occupied for a small while before I get anxious again, but it makes me feel even worse because I know I will never be able to complete them. All I do is play for a few minutes and start again because I accidentally skipped over a voice line or missed an item that I cannot get back to anymore.

I don't know what to do about it anymore.",Anxiety

"Help with coping mechanisms [serious] It's been a rough couple of years for me. To say I'm behind the curve in life is somewhat of an understatement. I have a great skillset in a field with quite lucrative possibilities, but I find it thouroughly unfulfilling. I'm one of those paradoxical people who keeps to themselves but thrives off being around people. I work alone and rarely interact with people. I've gotten myself into some financial troubles due to my lack of enthusiasm for work (I'm self employed and completely control my schedule) and some poor choices made while trying to help out a couple of people who needed it. I live alone and have limited contact with my friends as I'm at that age where they are all married/kids/moved long distances. I'm in the process of getting my finances back under control and will be looking at new employment options once that is taken care of. I've definitely been dragging my feet. 
I have recently gotten involved in a relationship, and I see huge potential in my SO. They dont move as fast as I have historically, which is really great for me, but I'd be lying to say it hasn't caused any friction. This is where my problem comes in. So much in my life is up in the air that I'm searching for grounding. That rock to hold onto when the world starts spinning and it all just seems like too much. I've been doing a decent job of keeping myself focused on what I need to accomplish for myself but sometimes I lose that focus and fall under the anxiety bus.
As I mentioned before, my SO moves very slow. It's not what I'm used to, but I like it a lot. A whole lot, actually. However, when I reach 'panic' I am realizing that I am looking to them for a level of support/intimacy we haven't quite reached yet in our relationship. I really need to take the focus off of my relationship and get my focus back on getting my life back in order.

"Coming off remeron/mirtazapine Hi all, I've taken mirtazapine for almost 2 years now for anxiety/ocd stuff, mianly about sleep. It changed my life and I've been able to live somewhat normally and am away to begin 3rd year of uni soon.

Anyway, I have become more more confident as a person, less anxious and that I told my doctor I want to try coming off 15mg mirtazapine. He told me to try one tablet every two days instead of one every day for a week or so, then to stop and see how I feel. Well I started that, then thought it would be best to do 7.5mg a day then try stopping.

This is day 2 without it, and I feel incredibly anxious for no reason. I had a broken sleep and I have the constant trembling feeling you get with anxiety. It's not overpowering, but it's not normal for me to feel like this, usually I feel chilled and relaxed. I'm guessing this is withdrawal kicking in already. 

For anyone doing or who did the same, how did it go and how long did it take you to feel normal again after stopping? My doctor told me to go back if I ever feel the need to restart this medication, but deep down I want to go back to the old me without the need of any med. Thank you.",Anxiety

I lost weight recently and that helped A LOT with pain from the injury, wasn't putting as much pressure on my leg I suppose.

"I won't let myself sleep I don't really sleep much anymore. It's about 12:30 am right now, and I probably won't sleep until three or four am, and I'll be up by seven. I'm averaging 3-5 hours of sleep a night, and I know that it's not good for me, but I can't convince myself to sleep.

It's not that I can't sleep; I'm actually incredibly tired right now. The problem is that I won't let myself sleep. I treat sleep the same way a person with an eating disorder treats food. I don't think I deserve sleep, so I withhold it from myself. I do sleep every night, but as little as possible, and I very rarely take naps. When I do nap, or sleep for more than five hours, I feel incredibly guilty and anxious. Sleeping just feels like a waste of time-- why would I sleep if I have a paper to write? What about the reading I have to do for class on Tuesday? Shouldn't I be washing the dishes in the sink? I convince myself that sleeping is only for people who work, the people who have gotten everything done, and that I'm selfish for sleeping for even three hours. I feel like I'm too lazy to even want to sleep, so I punish myself by making myself stay up even later. 

I try to keep myself from falling asleep at all sometimes. I've developed tricks for keeping myself awake, though it's difficult because my ADHD means that coffee doesn't do much to keep me up.

It's really awful because I'm not even doing anything. I'm going to stay up for hours doing absolutely nothing until my body forces me to sleep, and then I'll wake up and feel awful for having slept.

"Too anxious to eat So for the past 6 months or so, I've struggled to swallow food or thick drinks. 

Background: im a 24 woman living alone and My anxiety has spiked since I saw an uninvited guest very close to my door (and later found out my lock was picked.) since then, I've developed some OCD like habits (checking doors, peeking out of the window, waking out of my sleep to peek out the window, listening for voices, etc.) i also have hypnopompic hallucinations about 5/7 nights of the week. All of this prompted me to see a therapist but I recently stopped going due to some turn of events in her life.

in addition to this, I can't seem to swallow naturally anymore. If I'm eating, I have to consciously think about swallowing and ""prepare."" The good side of this is i chew my food really well. The bad side is I, as an already slow eater, eat VERRRY slowly now. To the point where if I'm out with Friends or on dates, I pick something small to eat like chips and salsa or soup or something easy to swallow that wouldn't take a lot of effort. I'm  ultimately afraid that I'll choke and die. I've never choked before, aside from the occasional wrong-pipe scenario as a child. I have no idea why i have this fear, it's completely unrelated to the anxiety inducing events I've experienced.

I used to be able to eat in my car on the way to somewhere if I was pressed for time, but now I can't even think about doing that. I keep water with me at all times, and there are certain foods i won't touch like crackers, cookies, or bread without water near by and I take a sip with every bite.

The only time i find swallowing easier is if i am so hungry i just need to shove food into my body and i don't have time to think about choking. So i only eat once a day now and that helps some. I refuse to starve or let go of my favorite foods because of this, but my coping mechanisms are so time consuming or specific, i can't be comfortable without them.

Paradoxically, I have to wait for almost two weeks before she considers taking me to the doctor, meaning I have to go to school in constant mental agony until the term ends. All I want is some more reassurance I do not have a Brain......

"Does anyone else make up scenarios are get worked up as though they're real!? I always think of fictionous scenarios and they destroy me. 

For example, I'll imagine my boss saying something like ""you've been let go"" and I imagine all these different scenarios of how I would react /what would I do.

Or, I would imagine a friend or friend-of-friend would mock me about being a loser because I don't own a house and the scenario would build up so bad and the thing is that person has never said anything negative to and/or about me.

"Graduated from college but got anxiety and ibs with it Just from reading through this sub i know there are people with much worse anxiety than me. But I am just curious, did anyone get anxiety issues from being in school and not ever be able to ""unwind"" after graduating?

I definitely think i have gained anxiety from stressing myself out to graduate on time and I was just wondering if anyone was able to get rid of it after you got done with school. Like I said I think I got IBS as a result of the anxiety and I would like to think if I can relax my anxiety I could get rid of IBS.

"I need advice Desperately. I'll start of by saying that I have GAD and Panic Disorder and it really sucks I've seen some therapists but i always alienate myself from it. 

The issue here I medicate with Marijuana, and contrary to popular belief it helps me actually concentrate on things better especially when i go to college. The problem is I cannot drive if i decide to medicate and my college is about 30 minutes away driving. I need to convince my mother who is currently unemployed and staying at home to at least drive me to a bus stop so I am able to be at school taking my medication (vaporizer at a smoking section) so I can literally pass my classes. She is pretty hardstuck an anti-marijuana but it helps me and I know it helps get better grades since im actually able to concentrate and not worry about everything else.

at this point i realized that some more info would help:
my mother knows i do it but she thinks its only 2 times a week
she doesnt really know about vaporizers
i dont want to lie to her
i want to let her know as like calmly as possible she tends to yell and its annoying

Update: I ended up doing it by letting her know that she'll see my grades exceed, she isnt happy about the driving part but she says for the time being she's fine with doing it. ",Anxiety
"Anxiety manifesting to other issues; need advice! I (f22) have had undiagnosed anxiety since middle school. A lot of it stemmed from being overweight and constantly being scrutinized for that (from family and my dance studio environment). In high school I reached an all time low and had very poor self esteem. I was depressed, hated being around people, formed an eating disorder, and didn't talk to anyone about my problems. Talking is not my thing; that's why I danced. Through college I used alcohol and partying as a coping mechanism since I no longer was dancing. Now that I'm out of college and trying to get more serious about my career, my anxiety has been getting in the way. My boyfriend has been great in helping me with my self-esteem and body image issues, but the anxiety has taken to other things. I always feel sick, especially before going into work and have had to call out a lot. I don't sleep at night but have no motivation to do anything during the day. Basically, I'm just looking for suggestions on what helps you, other than medication. ",Anxiety

During my childhood and teenage years I've developed really bad social anxiety and when I was in high school I had major depressive disorder. Thankfully the depression has subsided but the anxiety is still there and it causes irrational ways of thinking. Manic episodes and panic attacks. I've been working with a therapist for nearly a year. I have my dog who is my esa and I have different medications to help with the symptoms. For the most part I've made really great strides in my recovery but every now and again I'll have episodes that can last days at a time we're I'm cranky sad super happy. Just an array of emotions all at once. Its exhausting for me and I really value my boyfriend helping me to reformat my thoughts so that I can think rationally again. I just worry that how tiring it is for me it's just as bad for him as well. All I want is to be my happy ambitious self for him and be a positive thing in his life but I worry with my episodes that it wears at him.

"Horror movie 'It' helped with my anxiety Went out to watch the new horror movie It over the weekend. Before leaving our apartment my boyfriend joked about taking my heart pills in case I got too scared. We both laughed about it and also seriously decided that I should take it. 
(I take concor to stop my heart from racing which helps with anxiety/panic attacks. I don't get them often but I carry the pills around with me just to feel safe. I think the anxiety etc; came from a few traumatic episodes one of them happened two years ago, a group of gangsters purposely hit me with their car after attacking my friends, I'm physically completely fine now, fractured three bones in my spine then but perfectly fine now physically) 
The movie was of course, terrifying. There were a few times that I definitely wouldn't have minded taking a pill because of the fear felt from the movie and my heart racing fast at the same time but I couldn't really differentiate between the two fears so I focused on the fear of the scary movie. I told myself it was just a film with actors, directors and special effects. Ironically the movie itself is about battling fear. I got over the fear of the movie and subsequently the fear of my heart racing as well. I felt accomplished and perfectly in control. I had a sense of trust in myself. Something I haven't felt in a long time. 
TLDR: Watching the scary movie 'It' helped me battle my fear of my heart racing through battling the fear of a scary movie and not giving in to taking pills or walking out / taking a break from the movie.",Anxiety
"3 Months of anxiety In March I had an experience where I smoked marijuana for only the 4th or 5th time ever and sat down with my friend. We were watching TV when I felt like I was going to throw up. I didn't want to seem weird to my friend so I didn't say anything but my heart started racing and my mind telling me I needed to go to the bathroom to throw up, after a few seconds my vision started going black and I ended up passing out. I woke up to my friend trying to wake me up and said I was out for a few seconds. I went to the ER and was told nothing was wrong physically. A week later I went home to have an appointment with a cardiologist due to some family history, and was given the all clear after a few tests. All should've been good after that, but it wasn't. For the next 2 months I couldn't go a second without thinking about how I feel or having feelings like I was about to faint again, causing me to stay inside a lot. I started seeing a therapist which helped me a little, but not completely. Two weeks ago I had an appointment with an endocrinologist to see if it was something hormonal. He diagnosed me with pre-diabetes and explained that high insulin levels and low testosterone would cause anxiety. I have been on medication for the past 2 weeks and feel like I have been getting better and able to do more, but I recently just had a very short anxiety attack about fainting and seeing a vision of my friend calling for me to wake up. 

This is the scariest thing I have ever gone through in my life and I just want to be back to ""normal"" again. I was at my most confident and outgoing just before this, and now I'm a shell of myself. I can't do things with my girlfriend or anyone or even be around them for a long period of time without a thought popping into my head that I am going to faint and seeing them calling for me to wake up which causes dizziness and high anxiety. I just want to know if anyone else has gone through anything similar and if they ever got through it completely. I don't want to go through the rest of my life not being able to enjoy anything without thinking I could faint at any moment. ",Anxiety
"Pregnant and anxiety going haywire I've been feeling off lately. Can't sleep through the night without tossing and turning, lots of racing heart and thoughts, just general stomach discomfort that I attributed to anxiety. I took a pregnancy test today. I knew even before the two minutes were up, the plus was so vibrant.

So now my anxiety is tenfold. I spent the evening freaking out with my husband until I finally relaxed and almost fell asleep... Only to find myself awake at midnight nauseaus and unable to sleep again. We're supposed to fly to visit friends in Denver next week to go hiking and camping but I can't even sleep in my own bed so the thought of traveling is unbearable. My husband generously insisted we can just not go but that would be such a waste of hundreds of dollars. We've been looking forward to this for months and now it feels ruined.

Tomorrow I'll need to call my doctor's office because I can't deal with this right now without an adult advising me. I don't feel like a grown up even though I'm 27 and married and own a house and have a ""real job."" But the worst part is that I just saw a new obgyn there a few weeks ago and she was condescendingly insistent on how I'd wind up pregnant because I was too anxious to try hormonal birth control. She was right, of course. But I'll need to request a new doctor because I didn't feel comfortable with her, which doesn't help at all. To top it all off, I can't even see my life either way: with a baby or without. But it's making me horribly anxious even though there's nothing I can do until tomorrow. Another night of terrible sleep.

Usually I would take a Xanax but I know that's bad, even though my dose is a tiny .25mg. That's another reason I'm so desperate to see a doctor soon, I'm terrified of having panic attacks when I'd just gotten them under control.

"Relationship Anxiety TW for a brief mention of suicide. 

I've (21F) been dating this wonderful guy (24) for about 7 months now, but my anxiety has become much more frustrating as of late. It's mainly centered around fears that he'll leave me even though he's given absolutely no reason for me to think that (I was just with him at a wedding where he was the best mand, recently met each other's parents, etc.), but it keeps entering my head every few days or so and it's driving me up the wall and I'm sure he's frustrated with it too. 

I think this particular trigger for my anxiety stems from the fact that over the last 4 years (basically since I left home for college) I haven't been able to form any stable interpersonal relationships. I had a friend group I had my freshman year dissolved in a dramatic fashion 3/4 through the year, both sets of roommates I had since transferring to my current school left me traumatized so now I live in a studio by myself, I had my first relationship/love and that blew up spectacularly, I have no friends on campus, and my best friend (who I met while I was briefly in a sorority) committed suicide about 4 months ago. Additionally, I've started to realize I've lost my sense of identity and that might also be why I've become so dependent/clingy.

I try to talk myself out of my meltdowns about imagined abandonment, but sometimes that doesn't work. I'm seeing a therapist and have brought up these fears before so right now I'm just looking for adice on how to get past these moments when they happen and prevent them from happening in the future.",Anxiety
"When is a good time to let a friendship go? Been feeling anxious lately because back in June, during a carnival, I saw a friend from work who I had known for a while with his friends. I turned over to say hi, he saw me perfectly and then just looked away and ignored me.

Tbh, I felt very hurt by that and I decided to stop talking to him. I could tell that he felt awkward too because a few dayd after he said something to me but I could tell by his body language that he felt awkward and knew that he had ignored me. Since then we don't talk at all anymore.

So was I just being a sensitive douche, or was I right in thinking ""this dude ignored me when I said hi to him, so forget him""

I understand that not everyone wants to talk to me all the time and they have other things to do but idk. I'm just very sensitive when others ignore me. ",Anxiety

"Fill in the blank. My anxiety makes me do this weird habit: __________ I've been having an unusual anxiety flareup over the past few days for no apparent reason. It makes me do strange things, but they are far from harmful. Just weird. I feel like it might be fun to share what strange things yours makes you do!

For example, I need to confess my stupid but hilarious ritual, but I feel awful about it!

I always find myself in the same grocery store on my way home even though I'm not hungry. I will stand and stare at the bulk bins and even start getting that paralyzing feeling knowing I'm just putting myself in a stupid food situation, anxiety about making a decision washes over me, and suddenly I absolutely HAVE to have those dark chocolate almonds or banana chips. I get intensely excited! But feel awful guilt. Why did I come here? Why didn't I just walk home and eat my chicken and veggies?

I will get a bag, then  say ""no—you can't!"" and put it my pocket, but... then I'll come back. I might sample one chunk of granola, then walk away to the vegetables or something. It's a hilarious dance of ""should I?"" Or ""shouldn't I?"" 

Then I will slowly walk back to the bins again and then get a random variety of items, always sweet but ""healthy""...ish. I will never settle on just one item. I mix them. Most often I will anxious eat them from the bag while I wander the store, though I'm not even looking for anything. Then I feel guilty and have to get more of the bulk items so I can buy them. Other times I abandon the bag and instead grab something I don't need, but could use (salsa? Yogurt?). A few times, I've caught myself and said, ""stop this. Leave the store!"" And I slink away as if I committed a murder. 

By the time I get to the register, I'll either have no bin baggie to purchase or I'll have a comically tiny random assortment of granola, nuts, or chocolate almonds. I feel guilty and embarrassed because I'll have written down only one of the items' numbers to be weighed and scanned, and I'm afraid I'll get in trouble because the snacks inside don't match. 

One time, I laughingly confessed to the cashier at Whole Foods about my rendezvous with the bins, asking if I could pay even though I'd already eaten it, and he chuckled. ""We all do that, don't worry about it!"" But I felt relief anyway. 

If I do come out with anything, I anxiously eat the rest of whatever I bought while I walk home.

So about a week or two ago I tried to cold turkey it(Not my best idea) then after i couldnt take the brain shocks and feeling sick all the time so I tried going to 10 mg of paxil. I felt a little better, and then I went to my psychiatrist and she told me about Lexapro, and after two days of that I had the worst day of my life(This was yesterday).

I get incredibly scared incredibly easily to an abnormal degree.

 I am currently scared because I read the deep web thread on reddit, which has led me to worry about me or others I care for being trafficked or tortured. Which made me contemplate the prospect of secretly microchipping those I care for so that they can always be recovered if captured. 

I am also scared because I read some japanese urban legends like the 'red room'. This is terrifying me even though I currently don't even have access to a computer. 

I am also scared after reading about the milgram experiment and Stanford prison experiment because it's exacerbating my fears of the world being full of horrible traffickers and murderers. 

I am scared of some guy coming to murder me to the point where I have come up with contingency plans. 

I am terrified of terrorism in the uk to the point where I seriously researched conceal carrying. 

When I read 'anansi's goatman', a simple creepypasta, it deathly terrified me to the point where it influenced night terrors over a year after reading it, and I feared my mother, who was comforting me in the aftermath, was a skinwalker. It still scares me even though I read it 2 years ago.

"I feel stuck and ashamed of the situation that i am in... I am struggling with mental health problems, anxiety and I think possibly depression (although it isn't constant, the feelings come and go daily and hourly everyday). I've been on antidepressants for a few weeks now and they have numbed it in a way, like when I think of suicide there isn't much feeling, normally I'd be upset, but since taking the antidepressants I don't have many feelings or emotions. The anxiety is still as bad that I am soaked in sweat and worried sick about life. Unable to sleep properly, unable to function and just feeling ill. I am on benefits and my doctors have recommended that I don't work. 

I'm male, age 23, will soon be 24 years of age and I suppose I am not functioning normally, or the way I should be functioning. Normally people at my age are moving on with their lives, completing university and moving into employment, friendships, relationships, etc. I'm the complete opposite, I'm not working and I have never been employed, no partner, no friends, no life really. The not having a job is something that I torture myself with, I call myself a failure for not being able to work. I was raised by my Grandmother, my Mother lost custody of me as a baby as she wasn't right (drink, drugs, etc. - as well as mentally unwell), my Mother ended her life when she was 23 years of age, I was 5 when she died. My Father has never been a part of my life and spent most of my life away, when he got out he wanted nothing to do with me and I too didn't want to know him. I only have my Grandmother, there isn't any other family. My Gran is in her late seventies and I am worried sick about her health, part of the reason I haven't ended my own life is because I don't want her to be upset and hurt. I also feel like I have let her down and failed her because I don't have a job and haven't succeeded at anything in life. 

I have sought help from psychologists, psychiatrists, regular doctors and an occupational therapist (along with about 3 or 4 other therapists and 2 counsellors) over the years, but I'm still no further ahead. I was told that I had an attachment disorder by a psychiatrist then later on told it was a mistake. I'm not sure what is wrong with me or why I am unable to function, but really just looking for advice and some reassurance.

"Is Anxiety an acceptable College Essay topic? The college that I am applying to asks for an essay about something that we have learned in the past year. Over the past year-2 years I realized that my anxiety was crippling me. I went to therapy, and I got better. 

But, I don't really know if it's a good idea to talk about these issues in a college essay. Will this hurt my chances of getting in?

Any opinions, or any similar experiences would help. Thank you!

"Starting to fall down old rabbit hole of comparing myself to others... Hi There- About 8 years ago I had an anxiety spiral that led to a breakdown (hospital) and it started with me thinking ""I'm not successful; Everyone around me is more successful and smart; My life is never going to change"". After my breakdown I was actually able to climb back out of that rabbit hole and experienced some ""success"" both professionally and personally. But now 8 years later and recently have finished grad school but don't have a job, and my husband is very successful, and I am starting to have panic attacks about what a let-down I am, etc. Afraid I'm going to keep spiraling down but REALLY don't want to end up going to the ER. ANY advice on his to stop that spiral of negative thinking? ",Anxiety

Has anyone else had something similar or know of any good coping techniques / tips?

It feels as though I am disconnected from my body. I just know there is something wrong. My life doesn't make sense. Alas my brain also feels like it doesn't work at all and a lot of times it doesn't.

"The worst anxiety attack of my life today. So I was diagnosed with GAD about 3 months ago and put on Buspar which I was taking religiously very well for the first two months. However I started forgetting it in the morning, then would double dose at night. Eventually I forgot to take it at night then too and just overall got bad at taking it.

 I've noticed some of my anxiety symptoms come back such as chest pain I've experience for the last year. When I went to the doctor first, I explained to him the chest pain I experienced and how it rotated from my heart, to my arm, to my back and we did blood tests and looked at my heart and nothing was wrong internally.

So today I had class, I've got a commute of about 40 minutes. I was thinking about my chest pain today also since it's been back for a week now and my friend told me his professor who passed away basically in front of him in class died of an aneurysm. So I was thinking just in the back of my head, well you've probably got an aneurysm and it's going to burst at any moment.

While driving home today, I was kind of thinking about my chest pain. I was going pretty slow on a country road and all of a sudden my chest pain got worse. I could feel a panic attack coming on fast so I reached for some water to drink but there wasn't any. My chest felt like it was going to absolutely explode. My head started racing and it felt numb. I quickly pulled to the side of the road thinking oh this is it, I'm going to fucking die right here. I thought for a few seconds that I should call 911, finally I realized okay I'm not going to die, this is just an awful panic attack. I called my fiance' who wasn't able to get to the phone, then called my mom who also experienced anxiety. I just needed somebody to talk to, and I just started crying and shaking. 

I've had anxiety attacks before but they have all been mild forms of this and generally I've been able to calm myself down enough. This was the first time, I literally thought I was going to die. 

I also wear an Apple Watch series 4, it tracks my heart rate throughout the day with an ECG. My resting heart rate is normally around 76 or so, that's what it was at while I was driving. During my anxiety attack it increased all the way to 120. I just think that's kind of interesting.",Anxiety

"How can I help my Girlfriend with her anxiety? Hello - Thanks for reading.

I have been with my Girlfriend for almost 6 years now, she has always been a little shy and thats fine - but recently she has been having more and more trouble with her anxiety.

I can only really tell you what I can see with her situation, so I will make a small list below:

She finds it very difficult to do day to day things at times - She will struggle to go to the bathroom for instance if she has to walk through a room with my flatmates in it to get there if we are at my house - I would have to leave the room 1st to ""go to the kitchen"" and she would follow.

She gets very worried about small things, if for example she needed to phone her bank for something urgent, it would just not be done. I have had to help her with this exact situation before because she was too worried/frightened about calling.

She is very quiet around everyone but me pretty much - She hasn't got many friends that she sees, and has trouble with talking to people she already knows pretty well - I know she WANTS to make friends, but she just can't bring herself to speak up, or speak to new people.

What has worried me recently are she has had more and more panic attacks, from seemingly nowhere - Like sitting there watching TV and all of a sudden she needs to go outside as she feels like she going to have a panic attack. Once I have helped her to calm down, and asked why she thinks it came on, she says she has no idea.

I would also like to add that she says that she feels fine when at work - She works as a nursery nurse (Someone who looks after small children for those who are unaware.) Has no problems interacting with parents of children, other staff, etc.

I believe that most of this stems from her mother, as she is also a worrier, but seems to turn every situation into a huge issue, an example being making a huge deal about getting something from a cupboard.. Her brother is also epileptic, so her parents have always treated him like he is made of glass - I think this is why her mother is in panic mode about day to day things too, and it seems to have rubbed off on my girlfriend in the long run.

What can I do to help? I have tried being encouraging, I have tried giving into her and helping her though these situations as she would like, I have suggested that we go to a doctor or a professional, but she isn't very keen on this either, although she did mention an anxiety workshop that uses the Linden Method, which she didn't mind the sound of - and is the 1st step to getting help she has ever spoken about.

I just want to see her happy, and I don't know what else I can do to help.. I love this woman and she will be my wife one day should she let me! I just want to be there, but there doesn't seem to be much I can do..

Any suggestions or advice are greatly appreciated - I hope I have not come across as insensitive towards her situation. I just want to help, I just don't know how... I am here for her 100% of the way.",Anxiety
"I never realized how much these were affecting me I just came back from vacation, and I can honestly say that I never realized just how badly my job and living situation affects my anxiety. 


I usually suffer from nervousness coupled with GI issues and occasional panic attacks and back pain. I went on a trip to Hawai'i for about 8 days, and the entire time I was there, I didn't once suffer from anything. I felt more relaxed than I had in years, I woke up refreshed every day, ate whatever I wanted with no stomachaches, drank coffee with no jitters, and never felt any sense of worry.


Of course, as soon as I got back, all of my symptoms kicked in.

"Husband on Zoloft for about 2 months. Better behavior, but no sex. What gives? Hello. My husband was extremely mentally and emotionally abusive for a long time, and his doctor ended up diagnosing him with anxiety and put him on meds. After some trial and error, he's settled into zoloft (I believe?), and he's doing SO much better. I'm so proud of him for taking control and taking steps to get better.

BUT, now he flat out refuses me when I want sex. [A lot of our fights pre-meds were because he thought once or twice a week wasn't enough and meant I didn't love him... my how the tables have turned.] We go weeks without and his 'reason' is ""sometimes I'm just not in the mood. It's the medications."" Well, wtf. I feel so unattractive and unwanted. No matter what I offer, he says no.

"Because I'm not them... Today at work, we had a ""site meeting"" where one of our team leads from our department came and basically told us everything we weren't doing right. First of all, they were scheduled to be in at 12:30... they didn't get there until almost 1pm. They started with me, doing service observations. 

She noticed that I wasn't asking for money during my interactions with our patients (healthcare field) and said something along the lines of ""yeah, we're not making as much money from this location as we used to... not saying it's you... but we're not..."" There were 4 people waiting and I couldn't take the time to figure out what their deposit would've been since we're supposed to only take about 7 minutes per person at the very maximum. 

So while the lead was sitting in my office, I was registering someone she knew... she kept interrupting me to talk about some stupid shit that was completely irrelevant to work or the procedure at all. Then she would look at me and say ""are you going to have her sign (such and such) document?""

I finally snapped back at her saying ""I was just waiting on you to finish your socializing so I could explain it before she signed."" She always pulls that shit. And it felt damn good make her look stupid. She continued to bring people into my office and write notes down as she continued to watch while making stupid remarks. I felt like I was the verge of another panic attack... clenching my teeth, sick to my stomach, balling up my fists under my desk, and feeling like I'd snap at the next bitchy comment from her.

While I was finishing up the last patient that I had a service observation with, she left to go watch the other people working at my location. The procedures I handle usually take longer due to the need to access multiple encounters within their shell. I was nearly done when my phone rang.... it was her asking if I was coming to the back since there was an open desk. She knew I was finishing up a chart. She knew they take longer than most procedures. She was doing it just to fuck with me. ""Yes. I'm finishing up this chart."" 

""Oh, okay... because you know there's an open desk back here.""

""Yeah, I know. I'm almost done."" And I just listened for her to say something else. She didn't. She just hung up the phone. After she hung up, out of rage and hatred for her, I slammed the phone down. Luckily nobody in my office noticed. 

Later on, after the she-devil had left, two of my coworkers were talking about her and how useless she'd been while she was there. We were absolutely slammed and all she could concentrate on doing was nit-picking about dumb things while she could have helped. This isn't the first time she's gotten my anxiety flared up and I doubt it'll be the last. Too bad she's one of the longest lasting employees in our department and people see her as the queen bee. 

I can't fucking wait to get out of this department. ",Anxiety
"Anxiety as soon as about to sleep For a few months now I've been getting some anxiety when I hop into bed to go to sleep. I'll be casually browsing on my phone then I'll get stung with this real vicious thought loop that tightens my chest and makes me nervous. I feel as that if I don't fight it off with CBT techniques, I'll end up having a panic attack. 

My anxiety is usually pretty low during the day, especially if I'm keeping occupied, but it ramps up when the lights need to go out. The whole of last year I couldn't wait to go to sleep sometimes, because for whatever reason I didn't really have anxiety falling asleep back then. 

I have a prescription of Lexapro that I have not taken at all since being prescribed. Maybe I should just bite the trigger and start taking them. If it knocks me out before bed that's a plus.",Anxiety
"Geodon withdrawals For the last few months my psychiatrist has had me on Geodon as a mood stabilizer. Recently the nausea side effects had gotten worse and so at my last visit a few days ago I was prescribed a new mood stabilizer and told to stop taking the Geodon. The withdrawal symptoms, which I initially took for a bad reaction to the new drug Abilify, were almost immediate. I spent 48 hours almost constantly awake, maybe sleeping a grand total of four hours. Racing thoughts, physical exhaustion, it felt like I was going crazy. I feel like this experience is going to cause a further relapse of anxiety. I can already feel myself being afraid of leaving the house again. Anyone else been through this and come out okay?",Anxiety
"Does anyone feel as if you don't have anxiety then something's wrong? Personally I have had multiple bouts of depression as a secondary affect of my anxiety and about two of those times it has lead to suicidal thoughts, but before that I have realised that as I'm starting to become like that I lose most of my anxieties as if my mind can't handle both depression and anxiety at the same time. Anyone else have similar stories or experiences?",Anxiety
"I don't know where to go from here... Nearly 10 years ago my anxiety, which I've had since childhood, was mild and mostly manageable because I was settled into such a familiar routine for so long. The anxiety crept in on occasion, mostly when I was in social situations at work, but overall I considered my quality of life to be fairly good at the time. Then I got a new job, and quickly I discovered that the foundation I'd built for years was weak, and I watched as it collapsed beneath me. No longer was I in the environment I'd been accustomed to and grown comfortable in. The anxiety was back and was here to stay.

Over the course of the next 2 1/2 years, it took on a mind of its own. I completely avoided social events such as potlucks and holidays parties where I'd be forced to interact with coworkers. Throughout the day I constantly worried that I'd be pulled into an unscheduled meeting, and the sheer thought sent me into a panic attack. My work suffered severely, because I struggled to communicate effectively with customers. I constantly obsessed over the idea that I'd get fired and my family would be disappointed in me. The intrusive thoughts stressed me out so much that I would vomit. Most days, when I drove to work, I considered crashing my car and ending my life because it would be better than the 9 hour hell I was about to endure.

The anxiety increased outside of work as well. I worried about my husband dying in a car accident so much that it became obsessive. I began stressing over the idea of the house burning down because I left the hair straightener or the stove on, even if they hadn't been used. I constantly fretted over various bad things that could potentially occur, everything from our dogs dying to the apocalypse. It began to consume me day-in and day-out. I ate, slept, and breathed anxiety. I never got a break.

After 2 and a half years of this, I couldn't take it anymore and I quit my job. Immediately I felt the biggest sense of relief that I've ever felt in my life. The only way to describe it is that it was like I was being strangled, and then suddenly the pressure released and I was able to take the largest breath of my life. Just pure, satisfying relief. I enjoyed the next couple of months being unemployed and trying to get my life back in order. I began exercising and losing weight, reading self-help books and articles, and re-focusing on what I wanted to do with my life. The anxiety still existed, but it was no where near what it was. Reflecting back, I wish I would have invested into therapy at that time, but I didn't.

It's been over a year since I quit my job, and I've since run into a few brick walls along the way. I've fallen in and out of depression as a result, and the anxiety's intensity has flared up again. I've attempted to return back to the workforce on multiple occasions, but after working one day on the job, I'm left emotionally and physically drained from the constant racing thoughts, so I quit. It wasn't until recently that I realized that I'm trying to cope with my anxiety by avoiding it.

I don't know where to go from here. I want to work. I want to feel like I'm contributing to my family. I want to feel successful. I don't want to have to sit here and watch my husband work 7 days a week so we can afford rent. But my motivation, my reason for going, for trying- it just doesn't outweigh these repetitive and draining thoughts in my head. Once they start, they seem to consume all of me. No amount of guilt, or disappointment in myself, or motivation to be better can seem to make them go away. Even when I have short bursts of energy where I feel like I can take on the world- it's always short-lived because the anxiety creeps back in quickly. I feel trapped by my own thoughts that I seem to have no control over. I don't know what to do.",Anxiety
"I started working a week ago. After 2 years of cripplin anxiety I gathered all the courage to go work again. I work as a packet driver for TNT now.

With all the work it's like I don't even have time to be scared of useless things.

"mixing up words Having social anxiety is the worst. One of my worst symptoms is mixing up words. At a recent family reunion, someone joked ""Looks like you're getting taller!"" since I'm a tall guy. I replied ""Everyone's been saying that tonight."" Too bad we were outside on a sunny morning.

I also mix up prepositions. For example once I said ""How do your dance recital went?"" instead of ""How did your dance recital go?"" It's embarrassing and I fear everyone I've ever interacted with thinks I'm an inarticulate idiot.",Anxiety
"Depersonalisation/dissociation I have no idea why it's suddenly manifested but I keep dissociating at the moment. 

I do take medication for ADHD, autism, depression and anxiety, and I was able to think fairly clearly for a while. Now, however, I have severe brain fog, cannot concentrate at all and disengage from my surroundings most of the time.

Unfortunately I seldom feel physical signs of anxiety such as breathlessness and rapid heart beat, thus it tends to sneak up on me. :(

"Can't Sleep, Probably dying? Ever since a panic attack in my sleep, I have been unable to fall asleep normally. It is very difficult to fall asleep and when I do, I don't remember feeling really sleepy. And even then, I end up waking up multiple times or waking up early and having difficulty getting back to sleep. 

I'm not sure what this is. Anxiety alone shouldn't be able to cause this. I'm not sure if it was due to being unhappy with my life or is due to a medical condition I have yet to discover. 

But, I know I can't function like this. I can't focus on school or anything for that matter. I'm getting muscle spasms, headaches and heart palpitations on a daily basis. Doesn't seem like I can even get 3 hrs of sleep a night. If I get more, it is not deep sleep nor any quality sleep. Since I don't feel or look any different. 

At this rate, I am probably not going to survive for long and I don't care anymore. I just don't understand what is making it extremely difficult to get any sleep that doctors are not able to figure out or are not interested in knowing. It's not stress since I'm reducing anything that may be stressing me out. 

Is it from being really depressed? I don't know. I've been depressed before, never had any issues like this. Only since my anxiety issues spiraled out of control did this occur. I'm really convinced at this point that my mind is going to kill me. I don't know what is causing the anxiety or why I'm not feeling naturally sleepy. 

All that has to happen, is that my mind needs to induce sleep like it did before. Thoughts can't disrupt this. It has to attack me, I used to get really sleepy before the panic attacks. Nothing could keep me awake. Now I am not feeling sleepy at all. 

Is this adrenaline or what, and if it is, I can't seem to stop it. I can't control any of this. 

I am not even worrying anymore, but still having severe sleep issues. 

Sorry but wanted to rant, it's 5 AM and I couldn't fall asleep. Past few nights I slept but woke up 3 hrs later. If this is a medical condition, then really frustrated doctors can't figure it out and suspect it's me just worrying. ",Anxiety
"Is there anyway to beat [or lessen] the constant physical symptoms of anxiety?(Nausea, headaches, palpitations, muscle cramps, etc.) Howdy,



As i'm sure some of you can relate, there's something immeasurably frustrating about being told all the physical symptoms you're experiencing are all in your head. It's even more frustrating when the symptoms are constant. 


Is there anybody here who also suffers or has suffered from physical symptoms of anxiety (outside of an attack) that can offer advice or a way to combat these symptoms?



**Background information:**
I suffer from a multitude of strange and incredibly frustrating physical sensations and ailments (ranging from itchy scalp, to pulsating veins and tension headaches) which i'm told are from anxiety. Often, when these symptoms appear i'm not even consciously anxious, but I sure do worry after the fact. My troubles began when I suffered my first ever panic attack around a year ago, and since I have experienced the above mentioned symptoms and more. 

I have tried Ativan, but do not like the notion of addictive pills with side effects.

"what were your experiences with getting help via the NHS? (UK) Hi all, 22M here. I've been dealing with Anxiety for about 4 years now. 3 years ago I did a 10 week course of CBT that really helped via my university and since then i've been using breathing exercises to keep my attacks down to a minimum. 

(Trigger Warning), my anxiety often revolves around worrying about heart problems. I get pains in my chest a lot at the simple mention of someone referencing a heart attack (even as I type this). 

A few months ago I quit smoking and coffee/tea (i found caffeine and nicotine to be big triggers for a panic attack). Yesterday when I was at work at a new job my supervisor offered to make me a drink and not wanting to be rude I said yes. An hour later I had to leave work a little humiliated because I couldn't stop shaking and thought I was going to be sick. It took two hours to sleep when I got home and i've been feeling awful since. 

I've always been incredibly nervous about going to the doctors (What if they find something more serious) but today i've just decided i'm sick of these attacks and want to do something about it. I have an appointment with my GP next week and just want some advice/stories about how it went. 

Anyway, this ended up being a lot longer than I thought it would be, thanks for reading and please leave some advice. Cheers!

"my anxiety is driving my insane I think I'm a decent driver but today was just awful. I'm trying so hard to get over it but it's hard. You know.

Driving in the darkness of the early morning, I thought I hit a raccoon or something. It was on my mind all day and was a huge distraction. I made sure to pass by on the way home. I didn't see anything so I replayed my dash cam footage... I watched the stretch of road and nothing. I think it was just a bad pothole I didn't see at the last minute. I remember seeing something dark which may have been the shadow of the hole or manhole cover. I thought it was a creature but thank goodness it wasn't.

The paranoia of not knowing what I hit, which turned out to be nonexistent, was hurting me all day. I couldn't think of anything else.

Then for part two, on the way home, I was stuck behind someone merging under the speed limit onto the highway so I merged quickly before they could. I tried to merge into the next lane over so they wouldn't merge into me but I got honked by someone speeding past in that lane so I just gunned it straight. I was on the verge of tears for the rest of my journey. This was pure arrogance on my part. I'm torn apart by it but I try to learn a lesson from things like this even if I'm stubborn at breaking habits. Take your time, be level-headed, and be safe.

"New things always suck (leaving home) I'm super scared to leave home and go to uni. 


I am not looking forward to what I am going to study, and a new environment sounds awful and terrifying. I have tried to put myself in new environments for practice recently but it has just driven home the idea that there is nothing to be gained from stepping out of my comfort zone.  (tried to go travelling with a friend a few weeks back, had a lot of panic attacks and came home. tried go karting with friends a few days ago, felt super anxious and scared the whole time and ended up super bruised from a friend's mistake. etc etc.) 


I have been spending so much time at home in the past few years. My mother became ill and so whenever I wasn't in class I was at home to be near her, I did a lot of my studying at home. In that time and since she has gone I have become practically agoraphobic, I hate leaving the house on my own, 50/50 chance I will flake on someone if I have to go out on my own, 90% chance I will be late from being too worried to leave on time. I don't want to leave my Dad either. It sounds sad but he is one of my best friends, we share a lot of common interests and I love spending time with him. My mental illnesses have been making spending time with my (similarly mentally ill) friends stressful so he is a rock for me. 


I get so depressed at the idea of not living with him. Whenever he goes away for a few days I seem to fall into a low mood where I don't leave the house or eat well or open the blinds sometimes. Even when I am feeling super fucking suicidal it's never as bad if he's around. I'm really pathetic but I'd really like some advice. As I said I'm not very well mentally, so independence is not only scary but also not at all appealing. There's nothing I want to do with it/am excited about when it comes to independence.

I don't know if it's related or just happened that way..I mostly suffer with social anxiety, and I'm wondering what is really going to help.. I'm at a point where I've convinced myself that nothing will ever help and I'm stuck. 


Anyway; have you had any major success with mental health from focusing on physical health? What were your before/after results? Were there any other factors that could have affected it? ",Anxiety
"I need to explain my anxiety to my boyfriend I've been dating my boyfriend for over two years. Things are great for the most part but our relationship did not start out on great footing (he was seeing other girls and lied about it before we were official) however, this was a long time ago and he has proved his commitment to me but sometimes I do not give him the amount of trust he deserves bc of my anxiety and fear he will leave me or cheat on me. 

The most recent incident occurred because he followed some girls I didn't know on instagram. I had anxiety/created scenarios in my mind for a few days over this and I did question him about it. Now that my anxiety attack is over I can see clearly that I was not trusting him properly. 

I'm sad and ashamed because this isn't the first time this has happened and I don't want to push him away. I'm afraid that I've made him the most important thing in my life..he knows I've had anxiety my whole life but I don't think he fully understands it or knows that it is the reason I get so insecure and sometimes cause problems. 

I've decided that in light of this recent incident, I need to explain to him it was a result of my insecurity and anxiety - something I want to work on. How do I have this conversation with him without sounding needy and pathetic? He is so secure and confident in himself and I am not. 

I also want to try meds because it is becoming unbearable, but he doesn't really believe in them so how do I explain this to him as well. I'm afraid of seeming crazy when he seems so normal. 

He's made my life/anxiety so much better and I don't want to lose him.

"I've made a lot of progress recently. TLDR: had a rough past 2 weeks with uncontrolable suicidal thoughts. Upset my girlfriend and my friends while camping with them. This week has been an amazing turn around due to meds kicking in more and my own quest for self improvement which is fixing my relationship and friendships.


Its hard to believe two weeks ago I was depressed and had a terrible panic attack which led me to walking aimlessly around Home Depot thinking of different ways to kill myself. What caused that panic attack and depression episode was the thought of going to a friends birthday gathering in the woods to have a campfire...


That same day i called my therapist and got my appointment pushed up two days and I also called my doctor and got an appointment that day and went and talked to her about my medication.


The next week went better, started to see some much needed improvements due to my medication starting to kick in more but I was far from where I am right now mentally.


The following weekend I had a camping trip planned with the same friends and my girlfriend (who also went to the birthday gathering). I drove my own truck and my girlfriend took her jeep and our other friends in their own chevy. The trip was going well until my girlfriends jeep broke down... The stress of the breakdown ended up making her smoke which came as a huge shocker to me cause in the almost 3 years we've been dating I thought she did not smoke... This really upset me and caused a huge spike in my anxiety. Long story short I snapped later that night and said some things I shouldn't have which upset both our friends, my girlfriend, and myself.


I ended up going for a walk at 3am by myself down to the hotsprings we were camping near, stood at the top of the cliff next to the springs shining my light down the 50 foot drop into the frigid waters of the river below just wanting to jump. I stood there for 5 minutes imagining what would happen if I did, my girlfriend coming to look for me, eventually search and rescue finding my body, you get the point... Ironically starting to fear that bears or cougars might be stalking me and fearing for my life I walked back to camp and sat by the fire quietly until everyone went to bed including myslelf.


That weekend was rough. But i managed to pull through without doing anything to stupid. Anyways fast forward to today and I'm almost a whole new person. My meds have kicked in even more and are keeping me stable, I've read a few relationship posts on here and the advice given to the original posters really helped me with my own relationship issues, lastly I've started to let go of my not so nice past (drug problems) that I've been trying to forget for years. My relationship is back on track and my girlfriend is very happy with my progress which makes me happy ☺

Anyways sorry this was so long, I've just had a rough couple of weeks followed by a massive turn around which has left me beyond happy and is fixing my relationship issues!",Anxiety

"The movies gave me my first anxiety attack. I get anxiety sometimes but it isn't anything more than me freaking out over Somthing like college, grades, sometimes social things but never had an anxiety attack. I went to the movies today (resident evil) and was perfectly fine up until the movie actually started playing, it was louder then most movies I've seen at the theater and also I think they added a weird background sound to add suspense to the movie. I started feeling very stressed and my heart started racing I thought I was having a heart attack at 25, left the theater to calm down and it worked a little bit, went back into the theater and it came back. I had to leave, my hands and feet were cold and I felt so uneasy and my heart beat was fast. My dad drove home and I took a nap but couldn't fall asleep, the attack really scared me so of course it made me restless.

"Actually tried to go out today, Didn't end well Some backstory: Have dealt with depression and anxiety for as long as i can remember really. The depression is always what it is, but the anxiety has been absolutely kicking my ass. Today was a testament to that.

Was actually feeling pretty good today, very very anxious once i left the apartment, but good. So there was a small group of us who were hanging at my friends apartment. After staying there for a little while, we planned on going out of the city to get some coffee/ enjoy the beautiful day. As this got closer i just got more and more paranoid. i still don't know the reason why.

I was still trying to go (felt like today was a good day to push my boundaries), i haven't seen these friends in a while and was definitely looking forward to catching up some more. We all got into the car and i didnt even realize we were all gonna try to stuff ourselves in the back (there was only one extra but my god was i cramped in). My heart rate shot up instantly (i gravely dislike when i cant move around, makes me feel like im suffocating), and i felt like i something horrible was gonna happen if i stayed. I had to get out.

They were really nice about it and felt bad when i told them i had to go, and i felt absolutely horrible with the fact that i just bailed. I love those people but anxieties got the better of me today. Ill just sit in my apartment until they come back, or just stay here.

"How do u handle anxiety from fear of A secret being Discovered and then asked of u? I had sex. It was awful. 6 months later I developed growths on my scrotum. A dermatologist told me it was genital warts. I grew really depressed. She recommended medication which did nothing for the growths. I fell into a depression and she told me that I could get a procedure to have them removed. Whenever I;d go to another dermatologist for a second opinion, I""d try to bring up stds and they'd act disgusted, which then stopped me from asking them. Yes, a lot of doctors are very unprofessional and have stigmas against stds. I went to a new psychiatrist. She referred me to a dermatologist who was known to treat white gay guys and other asian gay guys with genital warts. That's how gossipy these doctors can be. I went to this new dermatologist and showed her my growths. She then showed me pictures of genital warts from her textbook. They looked like cauliflowers. They looked nothing like my growths. She told me I was misdiagnosed. I didn't have an std. I had sebaceous epidermal cysts. Had I never had awful sex, then I would have never thought the growths on my scrotum were stds. 

My question is this: given how gossipy doctors are, how do I deal with the anxiety of this past misdiagnosis from being asked of me? If a gossip asks me upfront if I have an std, and of course I deny it, then they'd think I'm lying since they either heard the gossip from the dermatologist who misdiagnosed me or from someone she told who told someone else who.......repeat the pattern of people telling other people thru gossip.

"I can't keep going, I am losing my mental help Hi,

My wife left for 3 and a half months for a free trip to Europe to study abroad through her university, I couldn't have stopped her, I had no right no stop her. I knew it was gonna happen before the relationship even started, but I had no chance of stopping her. 

I am someone who has gone through a lot, been through hell and back many times. I have been through major manic depression and she was the only person who was able to help. Ever since she has left, I have been going crazy, I am losing my mind. I cannot work, I cannot make friends, all I do is stay at home on my computer and drink and smoke, since those are my only coping mechanisms, I am in constant state of anxiety, loneliness and unrest, physical discomfort as I stay alone in a house by myself; I have so much anxiety and I have so much irrational fear that I lock my door rooms all the time, I check if my house doors are locked at least 20 times thorough the whole day, I cannot rest, I cannot calm down during nights, alcohol doesn't even help anymore.

I have talked with my wife about what's been happening, she feels relatively the same, but she has things to do, school to go to, a different country to explore, fun to have, she is homesick and has considered coming back, but hasn't because she knows that she would regret missing out on traveling Europe.

I need some sort of help to get through these 3 and half months because I know that I cannot do it, physically and mentally I am not strong enough to do that, I am so used to her being here, I am so used to her constant emotional support that I cannot live without it, it's so hard, it's impossible.

I cannot describe how horrible and terrible and dreadful I always feel, I cannot help these feelings, they're crippling me, I am incapacitated because of them. I pray to God and hope that everything gets better, but it does not. I cannot do this, what do I do???

"Is this normal? First anxiety attack 
I have been suffering from depression for a while now and working through that in my own way, coping, day to day, ect. But the other day I had my first anxiety attack.

I didn't know what to do and it was so sudden. I was watching TV and suddenly my brain was telling me ""You're about to die, you're about to die"" and I emotionally convinced that it was about to happen. There was a tiny rational part of me saying ""No, you're fine, this is what an anxiety attack feels like."" but I just couldn't listen to it.

"How do I break my anxiety and approach anxiety when it comes to women? I'm a 28 y/o male who has been struggling with anxiety and essentially forced solitude my whole life. I have really severe approach anxiety, to the point where I never talk to new people unless if I was forced to (coworkers, family, friends, authority, etc). When it comes to attractive women, forget it, it's near impossible. Eye contact is extremely hard for me to do as well, even if the girl isn't unbelievably gorgeous.


It's really pathetic, and maybe it's not always like this, but this is how it usually goes. ""Oh shit here's a pretty girl. *make eye contact*, shit she saw me, *darts away eyes instantly*"". Then at this point, no matter how hard I try, I can't make myself look into her eyes again. I use my peripheral vision and I can clearly see her eye me down, and sometimes 2-3 other girls eye me down too of whom I'm not currently interested in. Then I see her get up and walk away, and it feels like I can act normal again. Sometimes I look at her and she turns around and sees me, it feels like I had a heart attack every time that happens. 

Inside, I REALLY like it when I have multiple girls eyeing me down. I hate stroking my own ego, but I've been told by my friends and family that they are so surprised I'm not currently in a relationship, saying I'm good looking, built, have a lot of money, prestigious job, etc. Anyway I digress. I just don't know why I can't make that second eye contact, as I bring my eyes close to make that second peek, my heart sinks and I get short of breath. Then I even proceed to be lightheaded, and just give up. 

Just to note, I can talk to women and men in a professional manner easily. I have almost no anxiety when it comes to that as my job requires it. I actually feel very confident at those times, even when talking to pretty women. So it's weird, at work or when I need something I can talk...but with purpose. The idea of approaching a beautiful girl, knowing that I like her for a relationship thing instead of professional, and having small talk is just destruction to me, as much as I really want to do that. 

TLDR: hard for me to make second eye contact with pretty women at public. Anxiety symptoms kick in like crazy when I attempt to do so. I do not feel inferior to anyone. I don't think about rejection. My brain is just stopping me from making second eye contact. I can make eye contact with even pretty women in a professional manner, if my job requires it. Help please :D",Anxiety

So, I just had a friend get mad at me for not texting them for the day because I was very busy, and needed a self-care day for myself. She took offense and personal even though I told her I didn't mean to hurt her or make her feel like that. I was just very busy and overwhelmed today.

She is still hurt even though learning about today. I feel like with her anxiety and fears make it so I am turned into the bad guy every time I make a mistake. I don't want to be her friend when she makes me feel this way.

I am trying to learn how to being a caring friend or boyfriend with people who have anxiety. I get angry and I don't like that I get angry. What can I do to improve myself? I feel like no matter what I say, they don't believe it, even if I show effort, they see the negative in my actions. If I say I feel bad and don't want to go out, but I do go out and we have a good night out, she will look at the fact that I didn't feel like it at first. Even though I made the effort, I get punished because I shared that I felt bad and wanted to stay in.

I feel that no matter how good I try to be, this friend will look at all the negatives and I get turned into the bad guy that doesn't care and doesn't want to be a friend to her.

What do I do? How can I improve myself to be more caring? What approach do I take when someone says I don't care for them when I do care and have shown so much to them for them to see that I care and work hard to be there for them. There are just sometimes I need to take time for myself.

"Not sure if this is gaslighting or anxiety has led me to believe that it is and I'm just playing victim. i'm not sure whether or not i was dealing with gaslighting or if i'm just so anxious about the possibility of gaslighting that the place of a victim. i have a lot of problems with confrontation, usually shut down whenever my boyfriend confronts me about anything, and often end up internalizing anything he does wrong and finding a way to make it my fault due to not wanting to confront him about it. i also realize i've been idolizing him and it got to a point where i found it impossible that he could do something wrong. we've been dating for a year and 2 months, but known each other for almost 3 years.


- few months into us being close friends, he suddenly flips, tells me that i've changed, that i act like i don't trust him, that i seem like i'm hiding something, that i remind him of this one person who always annoyed him. 10 months later, he comes back into my life and apologizes for ever doing/saying that to me. i accept his apology and we are instantly close again.


- start dating. we are long distance. first time we have an issue is the fact he promises to spend time with me one night, but instead spends it with friends. i get upset, he apologizes. 


- we are being intimate (sexting, phone sex) once every few nights, but then his health starts to decline. he has hard time sleeping and when he is awake, he spends it playing video games. we stop being intimate for awhile and i tell him i miss it, and he tells me that i need to be more attentive to his health and he needs rest. we incorporate it back in as his health gets a bit better. 


- our sessions lasted 1.5 - 2 hrs because it takes me awhile to finish. he eventually confronted me, said his previous girlfriend only took 20 minutes, that i was stressing him out because i took too long, and he felt like sexting with me was a chore. from that point on, we cut our sessions in half.


- he eventually stopped initiating, and i noticed. i confronted him about it, told him ""it's probably just my anxiety and that's why i'm upset about this, i'm sorry,"" and he acted in disbelief that i would suggest anything was wrong on his end for never initiating. after a few days of bringing the issue up (while always apologizing profusely for worrying about it), he eventually told me he did still feel like it was a chore. he did slowly make more of an effort to initiate. 


- boyfriend knows i'm bisexual. accused me of not being attracted to men because he felt like i didn't talk about his dick enough during sexting.


- he told his friends that we say ""happy x month anniversary"" (it's never a bigger celebration than that) and they said it's weird. he then told me they said it's weird and made me feel abnormal for celebrating it.


- my cat died and i had to request for him to stop playing video games with his friends that night because i was really upset. he wouldn't have offered otherwise. 


- whenever i tried to get into a video game he liked, after awhile, he would tell me ""i don't enjoy playing this with you because i don't feel like you're into it,"" after maybe a day of playing together. i tried to play a fighting game with him once and he said ""i feel weird about playing this game with my girlfriend,"" and that he didn't want to play it with me... just because i was his girlfriend and not one of his guy friends.


- he had a few hospital visits due to health but he wouldn't usually tell me until after he was out of the hospital that he was in there to begin with. the first night he went to the hospital, i was unaware, so i started hanging out with a friend. when he finally did get out, i rushed my friend and told her i really wanted to call him because i was worried. it took me a bit to get into a call with him. he ended up really upset that i wasn't available immediately when he got home, and felt like i was prioritizing her over him. i made sure it never happen again, but months later, he brought what happened up again. i asked if he still felt hurt about it, and he told me ""you just don't seem like someone who cares about those kinds of things (his health)""


- he started to hide his hospital visits from me. i had bought a plane ticket to visit him months prior, and we had made plans. he was unemployed in this time and i was always asking him if he could financially handle a visit and if he was healthy enough. he always assured me everything would be fine. 2 weeks before i'm supposed to fly down to meet him, he tells me that he has been hiding hospital visits from me (because he felt ""it would stress me out"" to know), that his money is running out, and he has to go live on his brother's couch. he would have to move and live with his religious family and that we might not even get to sleep in the same room. i cry about the loss of our plans (and assure him i am in no way blaming him for them and that i'm just mourning the visit we'd planned for months) and he calls me selfish for not thinking about how much it sucks for him too. i apologize, and from the next day on, i assure him i'm just excited to meet him and that i don't care about the circumstances.


- i would ask him if i was doing anything that stressed him out, and if he wanted to talk about anything whenever i felt something was off. everytime i asked, everything was always fine, he was happy, our relationship was great according to him. every couple months he would suddenly bring up the fact he had been stressing about our relationship for weeks. when i asked him why he told me everything was fine when it wasn't (every time), he told me that i ""need to be able to tell the difference between right and wrong."" 


- one of my exes was going through a hard, suicidal time and asked to be friends. i tend to stretch myself thin to try and please as many people as i can, which is a fault i need to work on, so i accepted this and immediately told my boyfriend if the friendship made him uncomfortable, i would end it. he said he was fine with it. i also know that it is not my place to make sure my exe's mental health is in check, so i shouldn't have shouldered that responsibility at the time. i played a game with him once and my boyfriend said he was uncomfortable with that, so i immediately made sure i didn't play any games with my ex again, but we were still friends. my boyfriend would make jabs about the fact i was friends with him (despite saying he was ok with it,) and say things like ""he's in your dms again."" eventually it comes to a head where he says ""i would never be friends with an ex because i respect myself, why are you?"" and ""i'm embarrassed to tell my friends that my girlfriend is friends with her ex"" and lastly, ""it's not normal to be friends with him because you've seen his nudes."" 


- our ""talks"" usually start with him saying he doesn't feel i know what a relationship is supposed to be like. i have been in many relationships prior to him, he was only in one that lasted a month (as far as i've been told.) not to say that my prior relationships were what relationships were supposed to be, but i usually find it odd he critisizes me for seeming to have a lack of knowledge/experience about relationships when he hasn't been in one longer than a month prior to me.


- often times when he is upset with me, he will tell me that i'm ""disrespecting him.""  


- we are back to square one where he told me he needed 2 months of space. after awhile of talking to him about wanting to work on this and getting resistance, i asked him if he just wanted to break up with me and wasn't doing so because he thought i was emotionally fragile. he flipped it and told me that this 2 months of space was to give us a chance, so that we would work, and that i was accusing him of wanting to break up with me so that i ""could latch onto another man without feeling guilty"" and that i am ""just afraid of not having a boyfriend for 2 months."" 


in 2 weeks our break is over. i don't know what to expect because he's extremely unpredictable, and we have gone through space just like this before. i'm still as in love with him as ever, but 2 months of space made me reflect on some things that i thought were my fault. after talking about them with a friend one very drunk night, she told me it seems like he's gaslighting. at the time i found it impossible but now i can't stop thinking about it.",Anxiety

Yoga breathing has been said to be beneficial in lowering stress and anxiety. there is something called the 4-7-8 breath where you exhale completely through your mouth, then inhale through your nose for the count of four. hold your breath for the count of seven. let it out slowly through the mouth for the count of eight. then repeat twice more🧘🏽‍♂️",Anxiety
"how to be yourself? Hello, I have trouble with being myself around others. I'm kind of a social chameleon, and I change how I act depending on who I'm around. My end goal is to be able to be myself around everyone, but I'm having trouble. Whenever someone talks to me, I go into panic mode and usually just resort to doing a quick ""haha"" and smile. I would like to be able to reply to someone's question or comment directed at me with more than a ""Oh, really? Haha."" pls help.",Anxiety
"Work anxiety. Would love some advice! I'm a 27/f with a history of anxiety but the last year has been particularly rough with a few intense things happening. 

Anyway, I started a new job two weeks ago and today I called in sick because I just couldn't face it.  It's all new and quite high pressure job and the staff are miserable.  I cannot afford to quit so looking for some advice from others who have been in this position.  I understand I'm new to the role and everyone gets nervous before starting a new job but each morning I wake up just covered in sweat and can't eat,  diarrhea and a nausea type feeling.  
When I get to work it is so busy I feel like I can't think properly, and this just fuels the anxiety so I feel like I'm losing it. 

In the interview I actually told them that I suffered from anxiety and that I hoped it would be a supportive environment (I took this job after I left my previous job of 5 years after I was involved in an armed robbery) 


I am currently prescribed Valium which I take when my anxiety gets really bad but I avoid taking it at work because my work is very physical and the Valium slows me down (in a house keeper at a resort )


I would love to hear from anyone who has some wisdom for me.  I have a history of leaving jobs because of anxiety and I really can't afford to do it again.

"anxiety's killing my relationship, what is wrong with me...? Whenever I feel really disappointed by cancelled plans or when things are out of my control, I can't help it but get really annoyed and push away my boyfriend. I start to ignore him and always have this conflicting feeling of wanting to talk to him but also wanting to be alone. Honestly, it's driving me crazy because I don't know what I want and every time he makes an effort to pull me back to him I end up pushing him away AGAIN. He's a really great guy but my anxiety always causes me to feel unappreciative of his efforts even though he has sacrificed and done so much for me.

Also I don't know if it's just me but sometimes when we are together, I can never enjoy being in the moment and only think about how it's going to end soon. If anyone knows why/what this is and how to cope with it please let me know !!

I constantly feel so so guilty all the time dragging him into my problems, but I don't know what to do :( Please help!!

UPDATE: I would also like to add that I always get super attached and I'm really clingy and honestly really needy (all this is most likely bc of my anxiety) while he is the complete opposite.",Anxiety
"My fears have been confirmed. I always felt like what I have to say doesn't matter to people. I went to an event that's essentially prom for college seniors. Yeah, no one wanted to say anything besides, ""hi, you look pretty!"" My friends and their friends didn't bother including me in conversation, and when I inserted myself in some, they would just be quiet and talk to others about something different. I kept doing this, nothing was different. They'd smile at me and tell me I look pretty again and they're happy to see me, but the whole thing felt so fake. I get they may have been nervous, but it just didn't feel right. My college is small and has tight-knot cliques, but man did I feel invisible tonight. All I could do is go up to the room with my boyfriend and cry my eyes out. I looked beautiful tonight and wore a gorgeous $300 gown and I felt like that was money down the shitter. Idk if I'm happy I came, so I could find this out, or I should've known better and my bf could've saved a lot of money and used it towards something better. I'm invisible in lots of other places, too: class, work, my social groups besides like 3 of my friends. Guess that's just who I should stick to. But even still, I don't get why I seem so uninteresting and invisible to the general person...",Anxiety
"Woke up feeling anxious the last two days. Called out today. Feel like it's all falling apart I have anxiety and depression. I've been good for almost two years. Good meds. Good techniques.

"Job makes my anxiety high I graduated from college last spring. I got my first job in the summer.  It's a very high pressure sales position with a micromanaging boss.

I feel super trapped. My only glimmer of hope is the job in a completely different field that I applied for this morning.  I really need some support. Thanks ",Anxiety
"To those suffering with mental illness, here's my two cents I've been going through dark times over the past year, very dark times. Ive been struggling with many anxiety related illnesses, such as GAD, severe social anxiety, and OCD, as well as deep depression. Some days I couldn't even get out of bed and puked on an empty stomach because of the anxiety and guilt that I had harbored because of who I was and my past actions. I've also recently experienced death up close by someone close to my family for the first time in my life (drowning). Because of this, I felt as though I had seen the reality of what life and death truly are, and subscribed to existential nihilism and determinism as the only truths. And although there is something to be said about the truth behind these philosophies, it is no way to live a life. I became hedonistic, and grew in frustration against how selfish, simple, and quick to judge people are, and have hurt people, and myself, as a result. And although some things you can't take back, however much we may want to, I learned through my mistakes and delusions and now see suffering as an experience that no one, even the ""worst"" among us (serial killers, rapists, etc.), should have to go through, although suffering is an important concept i believe that all should reflect on daily. As long as they feel regret and guilt for their actions, anyone can change. Even those who have a psychological inability to feel guilt (psychopaths, sociopaths), should not suffer, as they have a genetic inability to feel this way. Although suffering is a given in life, what's helped me get through it all is Mahayana Buddhism. I could also link you to studies, but psilocybin also helps a lot with suicidal ideation and mental illness. It's definitely helped me more than you could probably imagine. I don't mean to preach about philosophy or come off like a snake oil salesman about how a chemical could be a panacea for your problems, but I seriously recommend looking into these two things especially if you consider committing. Because of Buddhism, and with with help of psilocybin, I now have found a sense of peace that I haven't had for several years and that I'm working toward enlarging, and now find great fulfillment in helping all living things, even those who hate me. I wish for you all to find your peace. Even if you have committed heinous past transgressions, you deserve peace and forgiveness if guilt and regrets arise. Just remember, humanity is both a very emotional and logical species of animal, but there is no ""supernatural"" intrinsic value to us. All of our actions can be reasoned through evolutionary psychology, developmental psychology, and abnormal psychology. Remember, you are your brain, and the brain is simply a pattern recognition computer influenced by neurochemicals. No one has more intrinsic value than another, we simply naturally feel that way as people because we are the byproducts of these three branches of psychology. To be truly happy, one must let go of worldly desires. The desire of ""I don't want to be sad anymore, to do this I must commit suicide"", is one of these desires. Such is the desire to please those you feel the need to please. Practice letting go of everything that you are attached to, albeit life itself and its basic necessities (food, water, shelter), and you will be on the right path. I've actually been practicing on letting go of the fear of pain and death itself, although this is very hard to do in reality. This is were meditation and letting go of the ego itself comes into play. The idea of ""this is who I am, and therefore who I will always be"" is one of the greatest fallacies of life, one that is natural to humanity, as we as a species like to label people as it makes us feel a sense of superiority, and through this sense fosters competition for the ""good"" ones in society that fit the current social model that society tries to ram down people's as the way to be ""or else"" and thus, pushes evolution, although it's not true in the slightest. People make mistakes all the time. However much society may tell you, your mistakes do not define who you are.",Anxiety
"how long does it take you to recover from a panic attack? I'm just curious.

"I guess I have hypochondria of sorts. How can I think? I have other underlying, probably unidentified disorders below this hypochondria, but I think this worrying is just making everything worse.

Basically, I'll notice a headache, nausea, pale or cold hands, and I'll subconsciously immediately assume that I'm under some sort of threat of death or damage.

When I try to make up a frame against it, I always run into the question, ""But what if at some point something's really wrong with my health? Shouldn't I be freaking out?"" And my defense just crumbles; I'm very afraid of death.

How can I better accept the sometimes very scary symptoms as just psychosomatic symptoms and not always impending doom?

"Struggling with Health-Related Anxiety Hello,

I have struggled with mild generalized anxiety for most of my life--sensitive personality, parents fairly checked out while I was growing up--my mother was distant emotionally and somewhat fragile, so my theory is that I was never affirmed or encouraged properly, just always felt uneasy and unsupported.

All of this peaked later in my life--in my 30's when both parents were sick and eventually died.   My father from an acute leukemia within 6 months and my mother from a long journey with progressively degenerative MS.  

At 48, I'm just beginning to feel like I have time enough to sort through what I've been handed.  Now that our children are getting older, I have more time.  Two months ago I began counseling and it feels good to have someone to talk with/accountability.

I particularly struggle with medical anxiety of the unknown.  Because my mother's MS was not diagnosed for many years and my father's leukemia came out of the blue, I struggle with fears that I will die young too and leave my children without the emotional and physical support I wish I had.  I fear autoimmune issues in particular because they are rampant in my family's history...aunt with lupus, others with rheumatoid arthritis, Dad had Crohn's, etc.  

Right now I am struggling with several unexpected physical pains that remain unexplained...in the process of referrals and trying to sort it all out.  This is the worst for me....the grey area where I struggle with a real physical complaint that has no diagnosis but also struggle with all the fears that it triggers which ultimately can lead to secondary stress issues which are physical but also maybe stress induced????  I hate this part of it all.

I just thought I'd introduce myself...would love to find a handful of supportive people to connect with who also struggle with similar issues and develop a dialogue that's mutually helpful. ",Anxiety

"Looking for some advice on anxiety. First sorry for this long ass post, sometimes we just need to talk and we cant stop it...

​

I think we've all been there, overthinking stuff, feeling nervous all the time, having negative thoughts about the past or just feeling impatient towards the future. That's my reality 24/7, literally being impatient, being anxious, being nervous, and getting more anxious, etc. just because i cant control it.

A few months ago (3) I tried looking for help, went first to a psychiatrist, i didn't really enjoy the sessions, i felt judged, felt demeanored, so i stopped going and tried a psychologist instead. It went good the first session, i felt welcome she even made a test and i felt kind of relieved, even for a few minutes. after that i kept trying to get more appointments with her but she kept cancelling week after week, and i just gave up. The following two months were not that bad, i mean, i felt nervous most of the time, but i could control it.

However the last few weeks have been hell for me, I've felt insecure, having negative thoughts in my head 24/7, overthinking everything in a negative way, i have tried meditation but it doesn't really help, i have tried literally unplugging myself from the rest of the world, I've literally looked for YouTube videos on how to deal with anxiety but no luck. It has brought me troubles in my relationship just because most of the times that anxiety and insecurities take control over me and i don't know what to do. It became a vicious cycle i just couldn't control. I came to a point where i would fight mi GF for no reason, and then just apologize, i really put to much stress into her hands (and she's got enough already), those actions made me feel even more insecure, and because of that the relationship has felt more distant, and distance has been increasing in the last few weeks, all cuz of me, i really want someone to talk to, i don't want a quick fix, i really need is help, for me, for my relationship, i really want to be better, is just that i don't know where to start cuz i feel that everything i do is just pointless, like i just doesn't work. i feel like i cannot control myself anymore, like imma loose that woman cuz of my insecurity and lack of patience, like i have said, it's a cycle, one that i want to get out from. i've even arrived to a point to which i over analyze every single text of hers and just think the worst of it...

"Anxiety re:dating again. Help! Hello. This is my first post to Reddit, so I don't exactly know the right procedure but I'm looking for some advice. 

I'm 23 and have suffered from anxiety since I was 8. I have depression too (thanks anxiety) but it's not as bad as my anxiety (which is saying a lot). In short: I spent two months in the hospital after an attempt at suicide, and now I'm getting shock treatment (Electro Convulsive Therapy, ECT). 

Most of the time I'm really great at hiding the fact that I have depression and can usually pass off my moods being anxiety induced, but now that I'm getting ECT I'm SO MUCH BETTER depression wise, but still an anxious mess. 

I'm not sure if this is supposed to go in a depression thread or whatever (I've only ever used Reddit to look at funny things so I'm really sorry if I'm fucking this up) but since the feeling I have is anxiety I'm hoping I can ask this here:

I'm ready to start dating again, which is a really good sign, but I'm terrified of being figured out as a fraud. Does that make sense? Like I'm not a full person, I'm a damaged person, and I don't know how I'm supposed to pass myself off as a shiny new car when I'm full of repair parts. On the outside (minus a few scars) I am normal, but I have been taken apart and put back together again, and I need monthly tune-ups (ECT). Sorry for the car analogy. I don't even like cars. I'm probably making a mess of this post so I'm really sorry if I'm doing it wrong. 

I'm trying the online dating thing, and I don't know where to draw the honesty line. Do I wait until I've been on a few dates before I spring the mental illness thing? Am I upfront about it? (In re: of them noticing the scars on my forearm). Do I pretend it was an accident?

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has had a similar feeling (of being a fraud) and how you got over it? Any advice?

"Climate change causing anxiety? Hello, I'm a 16 year old teenager with Aspergers Syndrome and Anxiety living in in Australia, over the past 2 years I have been having anxiety and recently severe mental breakdowns about climate change. it started when for science we did a topic on climate change, over the 3 months we studied the topic watching lots of documentary's and having a guest speaker in who essential told us where all gonna die. I began feeling more anxious and I was getting really dark thoughts, I tried to cope with it using my normal strategy of heavy breathing and distracting myself but it was always in the back of my mind no matter what I did. I started to take some action; calling my local representative (politician), recycling, being more eco friendly ect, but this seemed to only increase my anxiety. Winter rolled around and my fears where put on hold. When summer rolled around everything kicked back in but way worse, I started to have days where I couldn't leave my room because I was so scared and I was doing quite a bit crying, my thoughts where getting worse and it was affecting everything in my life. My psychiatrist put me on a small does of some anti anxiety medication and that made a positive difference but it was still pretty bad, but winter rolled around and I suddenly felt better. Then this year it has gotten really bad (for my standards) I'm still on the same medication with the same dose but for about half the summer (including Christmas and my birthday) I've been unable to function normally, I find myself avoid going outside and feeling ungodly nervous usually putting on 2-3 layers of sunscreen even for a walk down the street, the mental breakdowns have gotten worse I sometime hit myself in the head to give myself a headache so I'm distracted.

I can't talk to anyone about it because they all think it's signs that I'm going to kill myself, I'm not suicidal or anything they just think I am and want to help me which is a good thing mind you.

There's still one month left of summer in Australia and I'm going back to school in 3 days and I don't want everyone to th, is there anything I should do? Should I just get over myself? Is it just teenage angst? Should I increase my medication (my family's doctor says it's ok)? If anyone could help that would be greatly appreciated 
Also if possible try not to tell me to ""just accept it"", that method doesn't seem to work :(

Thanks a lot",Anxiety
"Does anyone else have a totally love-hate relationship with sitcoms about friendship? The obvious answer for most of us is of course is 'yes', but unsurprisingly the kind of people who ask questions on anxiety forums about using TV as a surrogate for friends are likely to be pretty lonely themselves, so I'd love to hear your thoughts.

Recently I've been doing a re-watch of Community, my guilty-pleasure show. I cringe at myself for liking it as a grown adult - the silly capers and ""will they, won't they"" romance plots all feel a bit like something from a particularly teeny YA fiction book. But as a person who never had will they won't theys, was always left out of the silly capers, and cancelled their university place twice due to anxiety, it feels like making up for what I've missed. 

Sad as I feel that watching TV is as close as I get to hot, fleeting romances, and spending time with friends, and making inside jokes, and working towards my future, it is as close as I get. Without it I'd be one step further away.

I don't really have anything more to say other than, what's your Community? And please be gentle about what I've said. I know I should be going out and living life but I'm miserable and anxiety is hell and I'm lonely.",Anxiety
My anxiety won't let me sleep. Does anyone have things that help them fall asleep? I often stay up for many hours at night because my anxiety is eating away at me. I put ASMR on typically to help me fall asleep but sometimes it just makes me more anxious. It's 12:30 am as I'm typing this and I have to be up at 6 to get ready for work but every time I turn off my phone and try to sleep I get so anxious that my heat feels like it's going to fly out of my chest :( ,Anxiety
"My dog makes me really anxious and I don't know how to deal with it. I could use some advice! My biggest question is how do you own a dog and not worry about it all the time? 

Let me start off by saying I LOVE dogs, I love meeting them, but when it comes to being a dog owner it scares the crap out of me. 

(My dog is an 8 year old golden retriever for context). 

I can't sleep because I'm always worried he will have to pee or something, I also have a phobia of vomit so if I hear anything that sounds like him getting sick I won't be able to think about anything else. I want to get over it really badly but the idea of him having an accident in the house drives me crazy. It takes over my whole life. I have to stay in my bedroom and stick headphones in my ears to try to distract myself and fall asleep. I am on edge when I'm with him after he eats a big dinner or something because I'm scared he will get sick. The slightest behavioral changes freak me out. I'm a hypochondriac and I apply it to my dog too. Vet bills are really expensive and a lot of the time I'm just overreacting. 

When there's a thunderstorm he gets scared and starts to freak out and pace and knock things over and I just start to panic and I lock myself in my room and cry because I'm overwhelmed and I can't help him  

I feel the same way about babies (well babies are worse but I don't have one) it is really upsetting because I love him but he makes me so nervous all the time. I only get relief when I let him out in the yard during the day and he's free to roam but that borders on neglect and I start to feel really guilty that he's alone but I need time to recharge. 

I want to be compassionate and relaxed and enjoy his company but I can't. How do I get over this? 

I've never seen anyone post a similar story so reassurance would be nice. :(",Anxiety
"How to handle stress in a high stress social situation? So. Here's the story because we all love some drama:   

I was with a guy for three and a half years, we had a messy breakup after I found out he cheated on me last October. Tomorrow, June 8th 2017, my best friend is having her college graduation party, to which we are both invited.  

He's going. And bringing the girl he cheated on me with him.  

I have general anxieties for just about anything: public transportation, social situations, food, and just about anything else. And this is giving me a ton of anxiety that I don't normally have to deal with to the point of having to throw up (hasn't happened, just a severely upset stomach).  

If I have a hard time dealing with my anxiety with still 20 hours+ to go until the event, what am I supposed to do when I actually arrive tomorrow?  

(I'm assuming we'll be there at the same time as I agreed to help out with the party). Any suggestions are appreciated.

"Simple EMDR you can do yourself to stop anxiety fast  EMDR stands for Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing. It is used most by therapists to help patients with anxiety, phobias, depression and PTSD. Here is a short (2 minute) animated video I found that explains how it works:

[

First you call up what is bothering you and making you anxious. Put whatever it is vividly in your mind.

Next move your eyes back and forth, back and forth.

In the video it says to go rapidly, but when I did it with a therapist last fall, when I do it on myself, and when I do this on my patients who are anxious\*, I go slower. I tend to get dizzy and I find going slow works very well.

By moving your eyes back and forth again and again, it helps your focus move out of the emotional part of your brain, and back into the rational side of your brain.

The effect is you notice that your anxiety becomes much much less. Whatever was bothering you loses it's emotional charge.

When the emotional charge is lessened, the anxiety goes away. \*Poof!\* 

You will notice that this works very quickly.

I have used this very successfully on my patients. I did a session with one woman who was so anxious before her surgery, she almost cancelled it. This poor woman desperately needed her knee replaced, but she hadn't been to the doctor in decades and was panicked on her day of surgery.

I now routinely do this with my patients post anesthesia when they wake up anxious. Patients with histories of anxiety or PTSD often wake up agitated, and this helps calms them very nicely.

It also helps me when I'm anxious, so I know it can help you too! Give this a try the next time you are anxious! If you are at work, just go right into the bathroom for a quick break.

Good luck!

"Recovering from anxiety and depression, realised that my past has been wasted by being ""timid and shy"". And this affects my future. Hi guys. My condition wasn't diagnosed and treated until the month after the submission of my university dissertation which is disastrously late. However I'm glad that I'm finally ""brave"" enough to restart my life as a graduate and adult. 

A few minutes ago I was browsing my younger cousin's facebook and saw her doing all sorts of activities, participating in a debate competition, being chosen to be a part of some well-known youth programme etc etc. My mind sank and shut down completely because I never thought that I could've been her. I could've been my current self ten/twenty years ago - much more willing to step out of my comfort zone, less worrying about my weaknesses etc.

**TLDR** I would be a more successful person if I was diagnosed earlier. I'm unhappy about my resume as it's mostly empty but I am willing to start low. It is just the thought that bothers me. Urgh. Am I the only one who has this feeling? How do you get over it?",Anxiety
"Feels like I'm going crazy I just had a weird anxiety related experience and I don't really have anybody to talk to about it at the moment, so I'm just gonna post it here.

By far my least favorite symptom of anxiety is insomnia. It's coming to the point where I'm anxious to even go to sleep because I know I'll just be up, laying in bed, thinking. Tonight I managed to get to sleep around 3:15 without much trouble, which is great. But then, suddenly, I was just awake again. I didn't really know what was happening. I didn't know I had fallen asleep. It was like I had amnesia. I knew where and who I was and everything, but it just felt like there was a gap in my memory. I checked the time to see a little over an hour had passed. After being really confused for a moment I began to remember laying in bed an hour earlier, waiting to fall asleep. I figured I must've fallen asleep and just woken up. Sounds pretty typical, I suppose, but the confusion that I woke up with really unsettled me. I could feel my thoughts start racing, and that classic feeling like you're about to lose your mind. I left my room quietly so as not to wake up my roommate, and had an anxiety attack, sitting in the common room in the middle of my suite. Now I'm just sitting here at 5:30 in the morning, not really tired, though I should be. At a time like this, I'd usually call my mom, but it's too late to do that.

Anxiety is pretty new to me, but there's so much weird, terrible stuff that happens with it. Stuff like this, and how sometimes the world just seems kind of off and different in an explainable way. How your thoughts just loop in on themselves, faster and faster. How sometimes my mind is so foggy that a thought will just slip right out, forgotten. And don't get me started on obsessing over some disease and why I'm convinced that I have it. Before I knew I had anxiety, I really thought I was losing it. Now I know I'm not, but it still feels like I'm losing it.",Anxiety
"Short term disability for anxiety I was just wondering if anyone had any experience with this. I was wondering about how short term disability works for mental health conditions like anxiety, and if it's wrong to submit a short term disability claim if you know you're giving notice soon anyways.

A little background: I just transferred to a different branch of a company I've been working for for almost a year. My current job is very stressful. I feel like they sort of pulled a ""bait and switch"" with the position I was originally offered, and now I'm doing something that is pretty different (and didn't find out until my first day) This would be fine and I don't mind supporting another wing of the school temporarily if they need it, but after talking to my boss about it, she was very vague about how long I'd be doing it. 

Ive also heard coworkers talking about how a bunch of the other people in the toddler wing are also waiting to transfer to the infant wing, and some are even leaving the school. I found out that the classroom I was supposed to open when I arrived has been closed for 2 years already, and the other teacher that was in there has been stuck in a toddler class for that long.

That would bother me in and of itself, but what makes me super anxious is that the *majority* of the kids at the school I currently work at (which isn't a specialty school, just a regular daycare) have disabilities or behavioral issues. My entire classroom is kids with disabilities and behavioral issues, and there doesn't seem to be much administrative support for that. The branch of this company that I started with didn't have *any* kids with behavioral issues or disabilities, so I was shocked that there were so many at this school. 

I've been sick to my stomach every day, can't sleep, lost my appetite, and am having panic attacks at least once a day. I already have a tentative job offer on the table, but I won't get my official offer for another few weeks, and then two weeks notice on top of that....

I just don't know if I can physically handle the stress for that long. But I don't know what sort of recourse I have. Should I submit a claim and then give notice once I get my offer? Is that a bad thing to do? I don't want to totally screw them over, but if I give my notice now, I'd screw myself if I don't end up getting this new job for some reason. And I know I can't handle much more of this. 

I would also be fine with taking unpaid leave for a few weeks, but I just can't risk losing this job if I don't get the new one. Any advice is appreciated, especially on how to explain why I'm giving notice so soon after starting at this branch. Should I tell my boss honestly why I'm leaving? Or should I just say I need more money or something like that?",Anxiety
"Anxiety about getting fired. Already being told I am too slow. I recently got a new job and I am just starting on my 3rd week. My training was pretty basic, it was a quick run down of ""this machine works like this."" and ""this is where we keep stuff.
Where I work is a juice bar, but there are many things we sell. Coffee, ice cream, smoothies, juices, and pastries. Its in a grocery store. I have been struggling to memorize the recipes and get things done quickly. The basics of everything I have learned how to do, and I feel I move at an even pace with my coworkers when it comes to making certain things, but I am much more careful. I do believe this makes me slower.
On Sunday my manager pulled me aside and told me I am too slow and I need to pick up the pace. Questioning if I really want to work there. I felt pretty upset and held back my tears until I got to my break. I know it is often I get complaints bout my speed, but...I did feel like I was finally starting to understand things, and it was hard to hear.
Today I talked to my other manager and she told me that there wasn't huge complaints, but my co-workers had said some things about me not moving fast. Especially on my second day of working there someone was very upset with me for not being quick. I talked to another co-worker who said I was doing fine, and much better then the other new person, but I still felt pretty singled out. I am also pretty uncomfortable with all my co-workers now. I feel hurt, even if I know I am not the fastest leaner.
Today I was also told that a customer complained that I did not ask him what he wanted while he was looking for a smoothie. I believe I saw him looking at the menu, and not at me. So i tried to finish something and wait until he finished. I assume he walked away, and he even said this happened twice, but I cannot remember just flat out ignoring a customer. Anyway I am starting to get anxious now. I feel I am going to lose my job, and I am trying to move faster, but my co-workers keep telling me mixed things. Like to work on a smoothie one at a time, when I know I can do two. Either way I don't know if I am going to get fired soon, and now I'm extremely stressed out.",Anxiety
"Are there any highly extroverted folk with anxiety here? How are your experiences? Having trouble finding others like me. I consider myself highly extroverted for the fact that I get depressed and miserable after a few days of not talking to people IRL. I'd say I've adapted a bit to it however because the cycle has been years like this so now I don't feel the full frontal effects anymore.

Texting and chatting isn't the same, they instead feel as if I'm getting a few morsels of a meal periodically rather than the full meal. 

Hanging out with a friend IRL, conversing and being in their company -  that results in the feeling of 'fullness' afterwards. 

Is this is strictly an extrovertive thing? Do introverts feel similarly?

I'm actually fine with talking and conversing to people. I'd easily be able to start a conversation with strangers. It's just that I'd feel anxious about my grades or work (or lack of) and shut myself off in my room for weeks. 

I have recently discovered Voice Chatting and am experimenting with it, I think it has potential to result in the 'fullness' I feel afterwards an IRL hang.

"Curious about experiences with med Hi,

I have extreme highs and lows because of my anxiety. Im a very up beat person but my very close loved ones know I'm suffering internally and can't handle too many options or too many familiar people, etc etc.

I have been managing it and my PTSD without medication for years, but I have now decided I would like to try medication.

I have a bad feeling for med treatments because I don't like that they can cause dependency, chemical changes of your brain, and withdrawals. I'm terrified of feeling better and not taking medication one day and all of sudden having 10,000 pounds of anxiety attack me.  

I have gotten very good at managing my anxiety and coming back as a happy person when I experience an anxiety attack. I would like to try medications because I think my body is just swallowing the stress and anxiety. I'm grinding my teeth and maybe I'm not actually managing it and just shoving it down. 

I have a therapist. I'm doing okay.

Could you guys give me your experiences with medication withdrawal and adjustment periods? Maybe some reasons why you went off it? Anyone who went back on it? 
Some stories would be really nice. Even if they're bad experiences.

I'm curious if there's like a soft and light version of meds. I want the weakest one possible with the least dose. 

I'm setting up an appointment with a psychiatrist. My therapist is cool, he reminds me I'm doing good in life, I just have anxiety and anxiety sucks the fun out of everything.


I send you all good vibes and lots of love. Anxiety is hell.


Thank you in advance.

We're newly long distance, which is why my anxiety is currently so bad, I have a lot of insecurities regarding cheating. The 7 months before that we weren't long distance, and I don't think I caused TOO many issues, or at least he's never considered breaking up with me that I'm aware of.

"Never felt so anxious in my life before. I need help stopping it. So I'm a third year vet student and I just finished my finals today. I started out with straight As in my first semester but with each passing semester my grades have been dropping consistently to the point where I got 3Cs and a B last semester.

Obviously I don't want to do bad, but I can't get the thought of my head that I'm destined to do worse this semester because of the trend. I even joked about it to my friends and told them I'm getting all Cs or I'm going to fail this semester. The worst part is I'm subconsciously fulfilling this future I don't want by procrastinating and being lazy. I just felt like the pressure got to me so hard that I gave up trying and I told myself I'll get whatever I get. But when my grades come back shitty, I think to myself why am I not as smart as the guy next to me, why do I keep putting so little effort, why do I not even care that I would rather get bad grades than get stressed out about it?

Now this mindset coming back to bite me. I'm doing really bad right now and I'm failing one of the toughest classes yet. If I don't do well on my finals I might have to repeat this semester and it sucks to feel behind my friends and peers. It sucks that my parents have to fork out more money for me to continue my education because I'm a lazy ass.

"I have finally figured out a coping strategy and I feel better than ever! Hi all, 

I guess the goal of this post is twofold -  to share in my excitement with a community who understands the hell of anxiety and to maybe offer a little bit of hope for those of you are are struggling: 

At 25 years old, I think I have finally found a way for my GAD/OCD and I to coexist peacefully. 

A year ago, I would never have been able to make a post like this because my OCD would have told me that it would ""make something bad happen."" 

The reason why I'm feeling better isn't some miracle cure or surprise. It's just a combination of medication and therapy. I say ""just"" because it is what is so often recommended, but I know the word ""just"" makes it seem a lot easier to obtain than it is in reality. I feel so much for all of you who are unable to access affordable therapy in your communities, or to whom healthcare is out of reach in general. There is a big flaw in our society. I struggled with getting the help I needed for years. This is what my journey looked like: 

Five different therapists until I finally found one who I click with. 

My first time in therapy was in university around seven years ago. I felt like I couldn't make any progress because I could not stop sobbing uncontrollably in therapy sessions. I remember my school-appointed therapist just staring back at me, blankly. 

My second time in therapy was a similar experience. Too many tears. So for long, I wondered what exactly was wrong with me. This couldn't be normal, could it? 

My third time in therapy was with a mindfulness specialist. I had no choice in who I was matched with because it was done with a government program that I had access to because of certain aspects of my childhood. I do not EVER want to criticize any approach to therapy that helps anyone, and I have close friends who have been helped by mindfulness. Personally, though, it does nothing for me. Being told to breathe as a way to combat the crippling social anxiety I felt during a hectic retail job left me feeling nothing but infuriated. 

The fourth therapist was a CBT psychologist who I was lucky to see through work benefits at the time (I HATED the job but the mental health benefits were good). He meant well, but we just didn't vibe. I think he did more harm than good to be honest. 

My fifth and current therapist is actually a marriage counsellor, but it's a wonderful fit for me because a lot of the things I need to work out are related to anxious attachment and distrust of men/relationships. It's very very hard work. Sometimes I leave a session feeling so drained that I can barely speak afterwards. Sometimes I leave a session and feel like no work has been done at all. But yet I also have those moments, the ones that usually hit me out of nowhere, where I realize that something that would have torn me apart before is simply managable now. 

My coping routine also includes some medication. It really, really helps me and I would never want somebody to feel ashamed of being on meds, but I won't mention the specific med type and dosage on here because really EVERYONE is different and it's a decision that should be made with a doctor. 

Speaking of doctors, I know that mental health can be a really difficult thing to talk about in a clinic - my doctor certainly isn't perfect - but I do have faith in medicine and its potential to help. My doctor said something to me that felt a bit harsh at the moment but has become a mantra of sorts for me now. She told me that there is no cure - only management. For a long time I felt the implications of this were so stark, but I promise promise promise, it can get better. Anxiety is a part of you, but it is not all of you. You are so valuable and so capable of feeling better. You deserve so much to feel good. 

All the best vibes. ",Anxiety

So i don't know was it anxiety, depression, stress or any other kind of things which messes up your mind, but i had struggled with it from about when i was 14. When i was 21 i was in coma, doctors where never fully able to understand what caused it, but best they there able to say was that, it was caused by nerve system damage by infection. After laid in bed for about 5-6 months. First two months, i felt really bad. My head was aching like crazy, and i had very bad back pain. Overall condition was really bad. I had trouble getting up from bad, because i felt dizzy. Then i just gave up and laid in bed all day. I wasn't watching tv and wasn't doing anything at all, besides talking to my family. I don't know what happened but after that 4 months, all my anxiety, stress and bad mood was gone. I felt relief and good, i was full of energy, felt focused motivated and ready to go. I got up from bed and hell, that was my best semester at the University. Everyday i was living full life, everyday i was having fun and making new friends. I felt so good that i wasn't believing myself. But then something happened and i felt to feel like shit again. That magical moment lasted only 1 year. after that it went downwards. I tried everything to get that good me back but hell, work, studies, family, friends, all this responsibilities. I never was rich and always had struggled because of money, but somehow back then i was able to overcome it. Only answer what i find is that i was able to get rest from everyday life, but at this moment i just can't. I have much to do and i guess many of you are in this situation then much is depending on you, and you just can't go and rest from everyone and everything for 6 months. If any of you have any advice how to do this without rest i will be grateful.

For example, tonight my husband crashed on his mountain bike tonight and got a few stitches, but was totally fine. He drove himself home and we were joking around in Urgent Care. I wasn't worried AT ALL. On two other occasions, it happened after my doctor looked in my ears, but that may have been because I had recently had extremely painful ear infections and I was triggered by that. Oddly enough, my daughter has special needs and none of her medical stuff ever makes me ill. The only non-medical time I had an episode was when I was doing a plaster cast of my hands and stomach while I was pregnant. 

I've never felt any sense of panic with these, but on every occasion I've been suddenly drenched in sweat, extremely nauseous (sometimes puking), and felt just moments from passing out (like, close enough that I risked lying on the doctor's office bathroom floor tonight for a bit...yuck). They've eventually passed each time, but I've had to pretty much remove myself from the situation. I did manage to go back to stay with my husband while he got stitched up, but I mostly just distracted myself on my phone until he was done.

Anyhow, any idea on what these are?",Anxiety
"We might break up tomorrow. And I have a strong feeling its due to my anxiety. I don't even know where to start. I think my anxiety has bewildered him too much in the past and now our relationship is too damaged beyond repair. I never taught him how to help me with it and he's grown intolerant to it. 

I had a breakdown last weekend and he said I needed to leave him alone and let him sleep and deal with it on my own. It just got worse from that point on. I've felt so abandoned. He apologized the next morning but ever since then shit has been so strained. I barely heard from him. I would tell him about my day and he would be cold about it. I told him we needed to talk on the weekend. 

I called him tonight after he ignored my texts and all he wanted to say that were gonna talk tomorrow and he loved me. I have such a bad feeling though. I know what's coming. I asked him if we were breaking up and all I got was silence.

"Help! Life-crippling anxiety about insects? I can't help but avoid insects at all costs, and it's ruining my life. Keeping open doors to a minimum, never ever opening windows, owning TONS of anti-bug products, sleeping with my ears covered by my hands so nothing can get in there, inspecting the corners of my house and furniture regularly... etc.

I can handle the occasional couple of gnats in my house. But having bigger flies, or mosquitoes, ants/bees/wasps, roaches, crickets, or moths in my house can send me into a HUGE panic attack. And outside activities? *In the summer?* Fuck. That. Shit. I'd need to wear a hazmat suit. When somebody knocks on the door and won't go away (so I need to answer), I have a ""mini"" panic attack since God knows what horrors are going to be waiting for me in my house after having a conversation with the door open. The fucking WORST part of all this is when they buzz by your ear (it always makes me almost scream out loud), or jump at you / instantly run towards you, or fucking CRAWL on you!!!

Believe me, this is not your garden-variety phobia, this is life-crippling. I would honestly rather die than live somewhere where safe, sealed, insulated housing isn't a thing or where there are truly dangerous bugs in abundance. Something like 1/3rd of my existence is spent on thinking about it, maximizing avoidance, having a panic attack about it, or running away and hiding like a baby. I can't do outside jobs / activities, I can't really drive, taking walks is painful and scary.

I didn't have this when I was little. I didn't mind bugs at all then. It developed/progressed the past 6-7 years or so (I'm 18). And I am *very* well aware that most insects are indeed harmless (I get ""but they won't hurt you!"" a lot, it pisses me off). I know that it would be rational to simply ignore them. But I physically can't! It's not an option. My reactions are literally reflexive.

***

I think calling what I have a ""insect/bug phobia"" doesn't get the point across properly. It's a lot more than a simple ""I'm a bit scared of bugs or spiders."" (Actually, spiders bother me a hell of a lot less than insects unless they're big or dangerous.)

I would be right to call this an anxiety disorder, right? Not a simple ""phobia?"" Does anyone know how I can get this treated?! I can't take this anymore... but thinking about exposure therapy makes me very sick to my stomach.

"Physical health anxiety and symptoms without any actual anxious thoughts This might be a little long, sorry in advance :/

A little background first: I'm a 20 year old female currently home from college for the summer. I was diagnosed with GAD when I was about 14 and have also had depressive episodes. I saw multiple therapists for years, although not right now. I used to take Lexapro, which did nothing, and then I switched to Prozac, which helped and I was eventually able to wean off of it. I am mentally doing SO much better - there was a time where I convinced myself I would never make it to college, and yet here I am on the Dean's List! So that's good. I am also employed and have a long-term boyfriend, which I honestly never thought would happen.

However, something that has plagued me since around the time of my diagnosis is health anxiety. For some reason, I am always hyper-aware of my body and any sensation I feel is magnified. I always feel my heartbeat and the second I think about it (like, even as I'm typing this) it gets faster and harder. Over the years, my blood pressure has also gotten worse and worse. I went to the doctor this morning for an annual wellness check and it was way too high for an otherwise healthy young adult. And then once that happens and I start obsessing, I start sweating and my heart beats harder and everything gets worse. It's like this awful cycle that I don't know how to stop. About 5 months ago, I went to a cardiologist for an ultrasound of my heart (it's totally fine), wore a Holter monitor for 24 hours (mostly fine, some spikes), and was put on metoprolol for palpitations and blood pressure. However, this obviously doesn't seem to be working...

So, I'm making another appointment with the cardiologist to discuss the meds and she's going to order some more tests to see if there are any underlying conditions to make my blood pressure so high and unresponsive to medication. 

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has experienced ""symptoms"" like this - mentally feeling fine, not really any anxious thoughts, but still *feeling* the anxiety - mostly in the form of a rapid heart rate, sweating, and high blood pressure.

"How do I stop being anxious about asking for time off from work? So for some context I recently started a job at a grocery as a cashier and it's been only a month and a few weeks. I need to ask for time off for my HSC (it's like the SAT I think?) and then later in December I need to ask for a week or so off for a family holiday.

I'm absaloutely shitting myself asking for this because in the month that I've worked I've already asked for a few days here and there off  for being sick and for just needing a break. Also recently I made a mistake by not giving 2 weeks notice for needing to take the 18th and 19th off for the HSC also and that alone is giving my anxiety a field day about asking for more days off. 

And I'm scared of the repercussions if I ask for more time off. Although it's expected I'll need time off for the HSC, before I started working i was told annecdoteally by one of the managers that they think it's a bit much when students ask for weeks off for the HSC. 

And in my interview I said I wouldn't be taking a holiday but that was before I knew about the trip. 

I can't actually think of any repercussions that could happen besides my boss saying no, and her hating me a bit for asking for time off so early into the job. I know logically that it's just a cashier job not my career and I won't be fired over just asking for time off. But anxiety isn't logical.

"I (24 F) am in a relationship with a great guy (24 M) and am dealing with crippling insecurity. I've been dating my boyfriend for around 3 months and he has never done anything bad to make me feel so insecure. He is very caring, supporting, attentive and affectionate. We have a lot in common and can be ourselves around each other.

I've been in one serious relationship before. It lasted for over a year and I was very emotionally bonded with this partner (same age, female) and never felt insecure. I never had sex with this partner because I had and still have severe body image issues. I've talked to him about this and he understands and is supportive and understanding of this. We slept together the 3rd time after seeing each other and now we have good sex multiple times when we see each other and it's helped me with my issues immensely. He always compliments me and is very vocal about how much he likes my body and likes me and thinks I'm amazing. 

I know logically he hasn't done anything and never does anything I should be upset with but the smallest things send my brain into a panic and I start to cry almost uncontrollably and then I want to hurt him badly or break up with him to save myself the constant worry. An example of this is when I see him like another girls sexy picture on facebook. I know this is common behavior and I don't understand why this triggers a meltdown in me because I know he watches porn and I also watch a lot of porn and I would have thought that porn would have bothered me more. I'm also quite into bdsm and have a lot of kinks I've been able to explore with him. This shouldn't bother me.

The part I also don't understand is I start to panic and cry but I'm not worried he would cheat on me or leave me or want someone else. I'm unsure why these things bother me so much and why. I just panic and cry. I think maybe it makes me feel poorly about my appearance but I'm really not sure.

After a few hours this passes and I'm head over heels and feel very secure in my relationship. But it always cycles back to anxiety and panic and it's constantly wearing me down. I don't think I want to tell him about this yet or ever but I probably won't break up with him even though it's obvious that I'm too insecure for this.

I'm sorry if there is a better subreddit for this but I just wanted to get this out quickly.

"Persisting anxiety how to get real help? Hi, i am new to this forum and since people here seem really helpful i figured i would try to ask something here.

Long story short, i suffer from anxiety since forever but it is getting badder and badder since high school (im 16) i also was diagnosed with depression last year and i am now pretty sure that the cause of that depression is my forever persisting anxiety. I was put on celexa first then they added abilify, it didnt work so i tried prozac, didnt work too i also got a psychiatrist and went 2 months to a sort of half psychiatric hospital half school (just to show that i am not at my debut) 

So theres my main point, during my stay at the hospital they made me try ativan and it reaaaaaaaaallly helped but i know that it isnt a good medication especially for a 16yo. Still it is the only thing that worked and now school starts tommorow and i am afraid that i wont be able to do the entire year if that anxiety persist (its social anxiety mainly, fear of being judged, being weird etcetc).

I really dont want to look like a teenager that want to get high off ativan because that truly isnt my goal i just want to feel good in public especially at school. So how do i do? How do i get my doc to prescribe me anything that can relieve anxiety or even just help a bit.

2. for some reason can breath easier.
3. less night swates.
4. increase in sexual desire. from not wanting to normal.
5. still not sure about the sleep. I think I manage to sleep full night without waking up now.
6. My only anxiety at the moment is that I will relaps. Scares me.

7. actually felt tonight my first was of mini panik attack for no reason. ok, might related to the beers I drank. 

Please, avoid supporting me by saying I need to go back and to taper it slowly  It's not my thing. But please share your succeful cold turky story. I need to hear some good things. I need to know that it is a stage that pass.

"my boyfriend might be part of the cause of my escalated anxiety I've had anxiety for years, however this past year my anxiety has escalated and I starting having more frequent panic attacks, which led to me experiencing depersonalization, which caused me to experience depression and even more frequent panic attacks. I've been trying to figure out why this might be and I'm starting to realize having a boyfriend might be part of it. We started dating last March and the first week we started talking I lost 7 pounds because I was so anxious and completely lost my appetite. Now I also was taking the ACT that week so I blamed it on that but it definitely was from the pressure of wanting him to still like me, it was my third time taking the ACT and I wasn't even worried about getting a better score. My boyfriend comes from a really nice family so I feel a lot of pressure there too of wanting them to like me. They know my parents and I don't want them to judge me for my parents because they know my dad was an alcoholic and my mom is very materialistic. They do like me I think but I definitely still get anxiety around them sometimes. My boyfriend is good to me. however there have been a couple of times where he was moody and told me things that still ruminate in my mind every once in awhile even though they were so long ago. One time he told me that he felt guilty became he had sexual thoughts about other girls and it made me feel very insecure. The person I was back then, I just comforted him but it really bothered me and still bothers me sometimes. I sometimes now compare myself to girls at my school and when were at school together I see him look at other girls and it makes me insecure. I think he likes one of my friends and I wonder if he only comes and visits me during lunch just to be around her. There was also one time when he kept telling me I smell bad. The people that lived in my dads house before us smoked I think because my dads house does have a musty smell to it sometimes. But that really bothered me and when I stay at my dads house I'm afraid to give him a hug for fear that I smell bad. He feels bad about these things, and even though they're so minuscule, they give me anxiety. I think I just never feel good enough because he is a straight A student, doesn't have mental health problems like I do, doesn't have issues with his parents or family, and I had all of this baggage coming into the relationship. He still is good to me but I don't think he knows how much anxiety he has unknowingly caused me, and I wouldn't say it's his fault it's just because I have anxiety.",Anxiety
"I did it! I posted yesterday that I had an exam today and I was in a state of extreme anxiety...

this morning I was having wave after wave of extreme anxiety. Never felt anything so bad. My mind kept saying I can't do it Im going to fail I'm going to let myself down. 

Got out of work and quickly downloaded some motivational speeches. One by Will Smith on YouTube called Self Discipline really struck a chord with me n inspired and drove me to fight the anxiety. I felt myself get stronger and the anxiety diminish. 

Went into the exam and honestly the section I was dreading...I aced. I passed overall. And that is such a massive thing to me.

Thanks for the support guys. It honestly can mean so much to someone in a state of anxiety,  just a few kind words!

"How to deal with ""hostility""? Wasn't able to think of a word better than hostility.

Here's the deal: Ever since I was little, if someone had ever so much as raised their voice a little or sounded the littlest bit ""mean"" it would be enough to send my anxiety through the roof and launch me into crying.

Now that I'm older, I don't cry as much, but I still get about as scared as an elderly chihuahua, though. I shake, my heart races, I sweat like hell, and my stomach starts hurting intensely.

I hate it, because that's not the kind of person I want to be. It interferes with my life way too much. I can't stand up for what I believe in, I can't make valid points, I get walked all over because I can't verbally defend myself when it comes to confrontation. And I feel like all I can do is watch, maybe throw up on the floor in front of me and cry, while it all happens.

I want to get better. I really do. I'm so tired of shitting myself in fear every time someone posts a mean reply on a facebook comment or disagrees with me on a general statement.

"Is my anxiety learned from my upbringing? Today I am going through a full anxiety attack. I had to go through simple steps of having law papers signed and notarized. As I guessed, I was totally anxious and confused! I hate this!!!

I am in the midst of ending my internship in a corporate company and I have been working on a presentation which I'm supposed to present tomorrow for at least a month now. Of course in the mean time I have also been doing other as hoc tasks but they aren't as near as heavy duty that could objectively affect my main work. 

I also have a paper to finish that I was supposed to assist an exec with due last 2 Fridays, but apparently I have been away from work for at least 7 days now, minus the weekend because I was just so anxious that I couldn't finish any of these tasks. At all. 

I feel stupid and incompetent. And worst of all I am also contemplating of not coming on my last day where my boss and my other colleagues already planned a nice farewell for me.

"How to get an anxious SO to make a decision without making his mental health issues worse?

I've not seen him for months (his anxiety is too much) and I am miserable and lonely. I don't know if I am single or not, my life is on hold and there's the pressure of keeping all this inside and not upsetting him.

I imagine the longer this situation goes on, the more anxious he will be about seeing me again. How can I reassure him I won't go crazy at him? 

I have asked before, probably once a month, I will bring up how I miss him. The most I can get are apologies, assurances he will see me again and affection... well as much affection as you can get by text.
Friends say I should go round his house but I'm respecting his need for space. Same goes for calling him and I certainly don't want to send a long text that will just make him feel bad.
A real time conversation is needed, how do I help him give that to me? I know that sounds selfish but.. I can't take anymore right now. All I do is work and wait. 
Also it hurts that I can't help him, I want to hold him, knowing he feels so terrible and he won't let me be there with him. 

I just need to see him again, or have him tell me we are over.

"I think my anxiety doesn't let me trust my boyfriend I don't know if this is the right place to talk about this, but I'm giving a try. 
This might be a long one.
(English isn't my first language, I'm sorry if something is confusing or wrong)

I'm [19F] a very insecure and anxious person, due to past relationships and bullying when I was still at school, and I know it is not just affecting my current relationship, but also me and I need help to change it.

I had my first boyfriend when I was 13 (I know it is too young) and we were together for 2 years. The start of it was quite weird, because he didn't like me at first and it only happened because a friend I had at the time, let's call her Sara, made his head to date me. After a couple of months we were together, he actually liked me back and not so surprising, Sara started to like him, and since they were friends, she was doing everything to him to break up with me, from telling lies about me to asking him to go to her house(they lived very close to each other), and he would go, I only got to know about it months after (didn't do shit at the time because I obviously was too dumb to think properly).

Sara was very close friends with Bianca, and also not surprising, Bianca also started to like him, so they would do meet ups at Sara's house and you can think about the rest. 

In 2014 I moved to another place, so I changed schools and we were still together, after that whole thing happened I started to be a really jealous girlfriend, I would accuse him of doing things that maybe never happened. One day I got a video of him hugging a girl from behind and that was the end of it for me, so earlier in November I broke up with him. 

Let's jump to early 2016. I moved back the year before and I got friends with Sara and Bianca again ( and I was still dumb). Sara was having a thing with this guy from our class since the year before, he really liked her, but she didn't want to have anything serious with him because she also had a thing with other guys. 

There was a party, me and that guy kissed and after that everyone from my class and school stopped talking to me. Sara again told lies about me to people. 

I met my current boyfriend at that year and we have been together even since, he really helped me to go through all the psychologist appointments and other doctors, because they told me I had ADD and anxiety also. 

We met on instagram and a year later he visited me, he spent half of a year here and we had a really good time together. At the beginning of our relationship I really trusted him. After some months, he went to work abroad, so we didn't talk much during the day because he was busy most of the time and then the overthinking, jealousy and overanalysing things came back. I have managed to try to have control over my thoughts this past few months, but it is difficult still.

My boyfriend is going through a hard time at the moment, he changed a lot since he finished his job overseas (before coming to meet me) and he knows that also. He just got really cold. He only realised he needs to see someone not a long time ago, and way before that, I knew something was wrong, because he wasn't as careful and as loveable and I know that he still loves me, he tells me he still loves me, but deep down it doesn't seem like it for me and it makes me overthink a lot.

When he takes too long to reply my massages I start to think that he is cheating and when I ask what he was doing, I think he is lying. When he tells me he is going to work, sometimes I think he is lying. When he says he is going out with his friends, I think he is lying and that he is going out with some other girl. I hate being this way. When I confront him about those things, he proves me every time that he isn't doing what I thought he was. 

I hate the feeling of it, I get really anxious, start to sweat, my hand and feet get cold, my whole body shakes, and this whole bad feeling takes me into a really dark place.

"Flying on an airplane anxiety Hi all, I'm looking for some advice on managing anxiety while flying. I've flown a lot in my life, I've been to four different continents, been on numerous 12-14 hour flights, and I'm just starting to struggle with anxiety while flying (I was diagnosed with GAD about 5 years ago) This is really new to me and I don't know how to manage it. I was on a 2.5 hour flight today, and I was fine for the most part. The pilot made an announcement when there was about 30 minutes left in the flight that we would be flying over a wildfire and we shouldn't be alarmed if we smell smoke. My anxiety went through the roof. I started shaking and holding my breath and catastrophying. With 15 minutes left we hit a huge patch of turbulence that go so bad everyone got bounced out of their seats at one point. I was shaking and crying and my mom had to remind me to breathe. It took me forever to calm down after we landed. This was a very rough flight, but my emotions weren't just usual fear. I honestly can't describe them it was so intense and overwhelming. My concern is- I have to fly back home in 2 weeks and I don't know how I'm going to handle it. After today the thought of stepping on an airplane terrifies me. I'm having major surgery during these next two weeks and will be in a lot of pain already during the flight. 

So- main question- what helps you all with anxiety while flying? Today my mom showed me videos of my dog to calm me down and that helped. I also watched the flight tracker miles and thought things like ""5 miles left, you drive farther than that to work everyday, it's no big deal"". I guess I'm mainly looking for suggestions so I can help myself, instead of relying on my mom (I usually travel alone).

"Any good blog post ideas? Hey guys so I have my own blog, in fact I have one for fashion, a weightloss journey one, a blog for reviews, and a personal one... but strangely the personal one has a load more views and I want to use it to inspire or entice people. Thing is, I've ran out of ideas. All I have been doing lately are little updates, which are really dull considering ""finished college"" ""looking for work"" ""still looking for work"" aren't the greatest updates on life. I've done like a mini series of posts about education and getting into College and what it's like living in dorms vs living at home etc. and difficulties I faced myself.

I've written about my own experiences, to an extent; however, there are many 'personal' aspects to my life I leave out because friends read it and possibly family. Like what am I supposed to write? ""How I overcame addiction when barely anybody knew I was an addict"", or ""How I survived two suicide attempts when barely anybody knew I tried it"", maybe ""How I dropped out after four years with huge debt yet no degree"". No? Yeah, my thoughts exactly- I doubt it'll make for good posting. A) I don't want people I actually know to... well, actually know, me, and B) It's kind of depressing, right? 

What makes for good blog posts that can be personal too? Maybe some ""how to"" ideas or a couple of reviews for now? Let them know I'm still around? What can I write that will inspire but not strip me raw, emotionally speaking?

I decided to start exercising and it helped for some time, but about two years later in 2015 it took me over and held me like never before. 

I was anxious all the time, I was on the brink of panic attacks like 50% of the time and the worse part is that I was 100% sure that I'm going insane. 
Another weird thing that came with my anxiety was that my mind was showing me pictures of me hurting other people (physically) but I never had no intention on acting on those thoughts or even wanting to act on them. They just came to me and stayed there. 

Having the feeling that you're losing control and unwillingly having thoughts about hurting other people led me to only one conclusion – I'm probably turning into a murderer. (Now as I type it it seems funny to me, but it was really scary back then)

Life wasn't looking bright for me. 

Therapy didn't really help, and when I started using meds, they only left me a bit number, but all those things didn't completely go away. I started to slip into a severe depression and stayed there for about a year.

That is when I decided to look for a solution myself. 

**Strategy that helped me to overcome anxiety within 3 weeks.**

I got myself into Stoicism and that led me to CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)

The exercise that I'm about to describe are not mine, but I've picked it up in books and articles. It helped me a lot, I actually felt a lot better after the first few days when I did it. 

The biggest problem when you're experiencing anxiety is that we do emotional reasoning – if I feel anxious or bad then there surely must be something wrong with me. 

For example in my case: I feel that I'm losing control, therefore I must be losing control over my mind.

This wasn't true, but at the time I felt that it is and that was causing the anxiety.

To deal with this problem I did the following exercise. 

I tested weather I was really losing control or no. I made a list of all things that I can do to test weather I'm losing my mind or no.

Here is my list of tests that I did. 

-	Count the alphabet (this showed that my memory still works perfectly)

-	Try moving my arms, legs, head, fingers and other body parts that move ( this showed me that I'm still in control of my body)

-	Then I would try to read a few sentences ( this showed me that I can still read and make sense of words)

-	After that I would chat up a colleague or call a friend if no one was around just to chat. (this showed me that I'm still in control of my verbal powers and I could understand what they are saying)

-	Do an intermediate SUDOKU ( this showed me that my cognitive powers still work)

All these tests showed me that I'm still in control of everything. I would sometimes do more, sometimes less, depending on how anxious I was. 

The problem is that when we're having an anxiety episode we think: ""If I won't control it something terrible will happen.""

But that is usually not the case. 

Anxiety has never made anyone insane, there are no recorded cases of anxiety leading to a heart attack, stopping someone from breathing (usually the opposite happens) or someone passing out. You might feel dizzy or pain in some of your body regions, but that is usually due to adrenaline being pumped in your blood, hyperventilating.

Hope this helps. 

If you don't think you can't apply it in your situation let me know, maybe I can help to find a solution.",Anxiety
"I keep reading people's awful anxiety experiences online and freaking out/panicking I know, I absolutely should not be reading anything online. I am making myself so much worse than I have to be. I have no way of verifying it (although I don't know why people would lie about it) and everyone's different but I just can't help it. I'm severely emetephobic and although I had gotten much much better it's been ruling my life for the past week while I've been away from home. I've felt nauseous with a tight throat every single day and could've sworn I was going to throw up but I never did. I've also been having a lot of bloating, heartburn, and indigestion. My stomach is totally anxious and out of whack. 

I've been reading a lot online about people who have thrown up 20 times in a day, 10 times in three hours, gagged uncontrollably, etc. I can't even begin to explain the panic that goes through my body learning that these kind of experiences ARE possible and could happen to me at anytime, even from anxiety. I want to cry and I want something to take this all away.

I've only thrown up 4 times in my whole 18 years of living, the most recent being 6 years ago. Each time I only threw up once. I am not a thrower-upper. My mom is not a thrower-upper (30+ years), my grandma is not a thrower-upper.

My mom told me she has never heard of someone throwing up that much and that it's obviously never happened to us. But I know that it's not impossible. I seriously feel like I could be sick at any moment.

I can't control this panic. I don't have anxiety meds. 

Please someone help me calm down. I don't know what to do for myself anymore. I know I need to calm down or else I'm raising my risk to gag or throw up by being so anxious but I just can't. ",Anxiety

"Anxiety about dating and the aftermath - any tips/thoughts? So I've been dating this guy for a few weeks now which is a big deal for me because I have never dated anyone before (anxiety usually gets in the way). He's amazing, really kind and we have the same interests but I feel like my anxiety is getting in the way. A lot of my anxiety manifests socially so it's obviously going to have an effect here. I'm worried I'm gonna put him off. Part of dealing with that is talking through it with my friends, but as much as I love them they don't quite understand what I mean. I'm sure everyone here can differentiate between normal nerves and symptoms of anxiety. I feel bad because I don't want to sound like I'm being ungrateful for the help my friends give but at the same time it is frustrating to hear 'just relax' or 'everybody gets nervous'. I know that's what I need to do but it's so dang hard to! So I just want to know if anybody has any practical tips on getting out of my own head or whether I should explain this to him yet. 

TL;DR just starting dating a guy I'm really into - any good tips for controlling social anxiety and when do I make it clear that this is a long-term thing. Just if someone wants to talk about this with me. Thanks! ",Anxiety

"Feeling Nauseous from breathing in mold So some background on this: a few weeks ago I bought a bag of oranges, and my dumb ass put the bag in the cupboard above my clothes rack and left it there until today. So today I wanted to eat an orange, and found that they were all brown. I pulled down the bag, causing a bunch of foul-smelling dust to get all over the air, myself, and my clothes, along with my shower supplies (my place is pretty small). I opened the window for a bit until the smell went away but now I feel slightly nauseous whenever I'm in that area. I'm worried about it spreading in my clothes (one of the clothes the mold got on is something I usually wear to sleep, and on some days I sweat in it).

"My life = Worrying about future events and minor present issues I wish I could just do simple activities without feeling like shit every time. It's just exhausting. Maybe that's why I seem to be tired all the time 😂 In 3 months I have a trip to japan without my parents that I constantly fluctuate from thinking ""it'll be just fine"" and ""idk if I can do it"" which is similar to any other major event I have in the future. I don't know what to ever think of how I'm going to feel because my thoughts can literally change in seconds. My life has been the same for too long and I'm ready to transfer out of community college to university. I want to meet people and live the college life but I feel like I'm stuck here until I become mentally capable. Even though... like I said... some moments of the day I feel like ""yeah I am totally ready to move out"" and maybe minutes later I'm not so confident. I feel like I'm missing out on life sometimes, and other times I feel like I'm comfortable in my life situation currently, as stale as it can be. Im such a fortunate person that grew up in a loving family that support me no matter what and I love myself. I just wish i wasn't held back by being fucking nervous. Why can't I just NOT be nervous?

"Information anxiety - First time posting Basically when I'm trying to study a TV show and write articles about them, or write an essay on a book I'm reading, or taking in and learning the newest set from magic the gathering, there hits a point where I feel like my brain is trying to think 4 or 5 things at once and it overloads and it eventually burns me out the point where I can't think and I lose all motivation to finish any of my projects, and then when I do pick them back up I feel so lost that I restart everything to feel comfortable. Usually I just shrug it off and keep going but it's been incredible bad lately, to the point where I watch casual comedy shows just feel like I'm doing something. Just looking for some help and sympathy I guess.",Anxiety
"How can I be productive after a panic attack? Hi everyone. I'm a 22/F law student who has struggled with anxiety for about five years (probably longer, but that's when I started to notice a problem), and I have a question about dealing with the aftermath of a panic attack. Any and all advice is welcome!

I typically have panic attacks once or twice a week. Once my body starts to calm down, I try to take a nap or distract myself on the internet until my anxiety returns to a less soul-crushing level. The problem I've found (in addition to the unpleasantness of panic attacks themselves) is that, even after the symptoms of a panic attack subside, I feel too exhausted to do anything productive.

It generally takes me at least 2 hours to get back to a somewhat normal place after a panic attack, but even then I feel really tired to the point where it's very difficult to motivate myself to do anything. As a result, once I've had a panic attack, I usually end up not doing any work for the rest of the day, no matter how early in the day the attack happens. I have an extremely heavy workload, so wasting one or two afternoons and evenings per week is not sustainable, especially because academic stress is a major contributor to my anxiety. I would really appreciate any advice on how to buckle down and get back to work once the panic has passed.

Note: I realize that it might seem more practical to approach this problem by trying to avoid panic attacks rather than deal with their aftermath more effectively. Obviously, my ultimate goal is to get my anxiety to a manageable level, but that is a long process, and this is a problem that I really hope to address in the meantime.",Anxiety
"How severe should my condition be for inpatient? I've had a pretty bad anxiety disorder for most of my life, especially the last few years since I started college. I always feel overwhelmed and miserable with my classes even though I'm largely doing what I love doing. But the pressure of wanting to do everything right and all is making me miserable and disenchanted with my life. I don't consider myself unstable or anything right now but I haven't been able to go to therapy since last summer. I keep wondering if maybe it would be good to step away from my life for a bit and hospitalize myself but I don't know if I'm ""bad enough"" to really need it for anything other than another escape ",Anxiety
"I feel sick to my stomach at the thought of going to work anymore I have such high anxiety when it comes to this job. It ruins any day off I have. I can't enjoy a day off because all I think about is how the next day I'll be back there and I'll be miserable. 

The job itself is pharmacy tech. Not a particular easy job and definitely not easy when you have zero background on it. I've had a total of 8 days training (not all in a row). My manager/head pharmacist makes me feel like shit every single shift. I'm getting scolded for not doing something fast enough, or if I'm standing there waiting for something or someone to help me I'm being told to ""not just stand there. You need to actually be working.""

Yesterday was the worst of it yet. The store just opened up and the woman training me that day was busy doing other tasks. I thought I knew how to do a task but turns out I didn't. I was confused by how the head pharmacist worded it and thought what I did was correct. Turns out it wasn't. She throws the prescription she bagged up back at me. Sees that I'm obviously confused and upset and yells for my trainer to come help me. My trainer is very busy and trying to get this done as first as she can. The pharmacist scolds her telling her she needs to show me the ""right"" way to do it. The trainer responds with how she doesn't want to get yelled at all day and I just felt so awful. I told her I was sorry, but it came out as a whisper. She, loudly, told me that it's okay and I'm new so of course I'm going to forget things my first week there.

The rest of the shift smoothed out but honestly I just fucking hate it. I hate this job. I thought it would be better than waitressing somewhere and it isn't. Something else I also think about is I'm the only person there in my age range who isn't studying to become a pharmacist. Of course, all the other 20-somethings don't mind it because they need the hours. I just keep having the thought of, ""I don't need her shit"" run through my mind.

To be totally honest, the urge to just never show up there again is so strong. I want to ghost them so bad. I know that's awful and it's the wrong way to handle this, but fuck...this job causes me such anxiety and stress. I wouldn't mind it so much if it was my career, but it's not. It has nothing to do with what I studied.",Anxiety
"Does anyone else feel anxious about putting mind-altering substances into their body? I have anxiety with traveling and situations where I could be ""trapped."" But something else I deal with that really isn't a huge thing, it just sucks sometimes, is being able to have a drink or smoke weed. Before I started having an anxiety disorder, I was a regular stoner and would drink occasionally. Its been years since I've had either because i'm just way too terrified to try it again. I've been fine without either of them obviously, but sometimes I wish that I could kick back with friends and have fun and relax with either.",Anxiety
Over reacting Lately I seem to over react about everything. But it doesn't feel like an over reaction till a while later. I looked it up and it just said hormonal changes cause it since I'm 16 F. But in the moment it feels like my world is collapsing around me and nothing is going to work out. My counsellor says to think about the effect this will have tomorrow in a month and in a year. But I can't. I've tried and it doesn't work. I don't know what to do but I feel like I'm going to lose everyone I love because of it. ,Anxiety
"Physical symptoms without feeling ""anxious?"" I've been having a lot of physical symptoms lately that are incredibly alarming and don't always line up with conscious anxious thoughts or feelings. Heart racing/unable to relax at night, feeling light headed at times, etc. I started lexapro 3 weeks ago which has helped a ton, but yesterday had an episode walking in to work where my heart started racing/skipping beats and I felt light headed out of nowhere. It was a normal day and I wasn't anxious about anything, at least not consciously. Went to the er and of course nothing was wrong. I've gone/am going through a battery of tests and so far everything looks perfectly normal. I just have such a hard time all these symptoms are JUST anxiety.",Anxiety

Last night, while I was laying in bed with my eyes closed, and when it did my arms passively moved to my waist as if I was trying to imagine what it would be like to be the kid in that interaction, and this freaked me out.

"party anxiety ... and other things An old friend invited me over to a small party she was having. You could say it was more of a get together, there were no more than 15 people at a time. It was only people I remember from years ago in MS and HS, or people I have met several times. The night was full of a series of moments that I will be kicking myself in the head for later-- starting with the fact that I introduced myself to someone with ""I haven't seen you in a while!"" and they said ""Oh really? I'm sorry what's your name?"". Ouch. Strike 1. 
I'm one of the only people not drinking and I'm also not in any convos, so I push myself to sit near an acquaintance talking with some buff guy I've met like 3 times. I just sit there casually and listen until the buff guy goes ""I'm sorry, I don't really feel comfortable talking with you here."" and he WAITS for me to leave. Wtf right? My acquaintance goes ""But she's cool!"". Buff guy says ""Yeah but I don't know her."" Then they just leave me sitting there on the couch. Strike 2.
My friend who is hosting the party sees me chiling on the couch and asks what's up. Laughing, I tell her what happened and I say that I didn't mind and I just went back to reading my NPR article on my phone. She laughs, then forces some of her friends to talk to me, it's a girl and a guy. As if that wasn't embarrassing enough, I spend a while talking to them and my god they looked so fucking bored. After a while, the girl says she's taking off, the guy looks at her and asks for a ride. They agree they'll leave together. They both get up and turn around, saying bye to me and start talking to some other people with no intention of leaving-- I was closed out of the circle... again. That was strike 3, and I was out of there. 
The only good thing that came out of this was that I met my friend's boyfriend and he was fucking awesome. Hopefully I made my friend happy in going, that way this was actually worth something. I wanna say this is why I don't go out and put myself in situations like these, so I won't get anxious and I won't get burned by people's stupidity and insensitivity.... But maybe I get anxious and hurt because I don't do it enough. I mean that's part of the reason why I didn't run out at the first sign of trouble. I thought it might do me good.

"Are mood swings common with anxiety/depression? I have recently started to analyze myself more and have noticed that ever since I can remember I've had these mood swings. 

It's usually not without reason at all, sometimes either something really good happens like a cute girl looks at me and smiles and that makes me feel elated for at least the next 2-3 hours, or something bad happens and I get very irritable and my self esteem dips.

Now, I don't think that I am bipolar because my bad moods aren't that bad, yes i feel like shit as a person and I don't like anything about myself and  the anger gets really bad sometimes but it usually goes away if I do something that I enjoy. My good moods make me feel great like a person and I start to love things about myself that I usually disliked/hated, but it's not like I go out and try to pick up random women, do drugs, or spend all my money. Most of the time I can change my mood just by thinking, calming or pumping myself up mentally.

I'm just wondering if this is common, or if I should see a therapist for potential bipolar/BPD?

And I don't remember anything else super significant besides like being afraid of speaking at school and things like that. Then I hit middle school and I was constantly having anxiety attacks almost everyday. My first day of 7th I had a full blown panic attack and thought I was dying. By the time highschool came around I absolutely dreaded being trapped in that box and I didn't realize it was just that until I dropped out. I started homeschooling my 11th grade year and from there I just didn't finish. Now, the big one.

I got home and everything seemed to get a little better, but then I had the most terrifying panic attack to date. I thought I was dying and losing my sanity all at once. I made my father drive me to the E.R. and I eventually calmed down in the waiting room and fell asleep. My dad took me home and I felt a little better but I was still practically shaking. I thought it was just all in a days work but oh boy was I wrong. I woke up the next morning and within 5 minutes of being conscious I started panicking. My dad gave me some medicine and from that day in I honestly can't remember about 1-2 of my life. I was diagnosed with panic disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, agoraphobia and clinical depression. I didn't leave the house for about 10.5 months. Then one day I broke my chains of gripping fear and drove my car to town. (Talk about baby steps) and I started doing better from there. Taking longer trips and driving myself more places. Life was good up until late December of 2016. I had taken a vacation with my family to the smokey mountains. It was great. On my way home, I was driving my girlfriend and I in her car, I was hit by a garbage truck. She was damn near scratch free but I shattered my femur, broke my heel, dislocated my knee cap, fractured my wrist, bruised some ribs and my back was kinda sore lol. Oh and I was less then .5 of a mile away from when we were hit. I spent a total of 13 days in the hospital and when I got home I couldn't wait to get better and get back out there. I honestly recognized how strangley good I felt to be so broken. I would have my cousin and girlfriend drive me to places like Walmart, game stop, the tattoo parlour that's like 30 fucking miles away from my town and normal fun stuff like that. Then as I start to get better and don't have to use a walker to hold me up and walk around with it start driving myself around again. Then one night while driving myself and my dog to a buddies house, I start having a panic attack. I was just as surprised as I was afraid. I booked it to the homies place and calmed down. I got frustrated as hell with myself because I thought I was past that point in my life. Even though I was still on anti anxiety meds and an anti depressant. So I go home that night and tell my dad about it, He's kinda my Yoda about everything, and he agreed that it was kinda weird that I had another panic attack after so long without a major incident. But as you guys know, that's how this shit works. Now, as a weaned myself off of the pain medication i felt worse and worse. My anxiety disorders were coming back and I knew it. In March of this year my sister was in a car accident, on the same road and spot that mine was in, and now has a TBI (traumatic brain injury). My family was gone for close to 2 months staying with her in the hospital and rehab after that. I couldn't go see her. I saw at my hometown hospital in the ER and thought I was going to watch her die. Then she was moved to a hospital in Nashville Tennessee. 2 &1/2 hours away from home. My family is home now and have been for almost a month. I cannot get past the stop sign at the end of my road. I fear that this will be the rest of my life and I will end up losing my sanity or killing myself or both. I just want to know if anyone out there is dealing with there own internal struggles. If there's any hope. ",Anxiety
"DAE feel Like they are just waiting for their next panic attack? Its like I can't get it out of my head. Most of my panic attacks are related to somatic feelings (Palpitations, any kind of weird chest feeling). Once it happens it feels like I am just waiting for the next one to happen. It's crazy to me how a 5-10 minute panic attack can have an effect over me for so long. It's really depressing, I am so sick of this bullshit.    ",Anxiety
"Is it normal to develop tics as a result of anxiety? For the past 3 or 4 months I have had this compulsion to tense my neck or nod my head extremely fast. I used to have this when I was younger but it was also coupled with shoulder shrugging. However that faded after a couple of months. One way I have managed to reduce the obviousness of the nodding has been to tense the back of my neck but this isn't a solution.

Fast forward some years and my 2nd year of college my meds were no longer effective and I was barely functional, so I pulled out of school and lost a year. Then, when I tried to return a year later, I got conned out of an apartment and had nowhere to stay, so I lost another semester. Now I'm back at school and I'm realizing that I don't think it's possible for me to graduate from here without being ridiculously in debt, and no matter how bad I want it, it's just not worth it.

I recently got a new full time job in a different city, and am on the verge of calling them to say I can't do it, despite going through all the checks and getting a start date (next Monday). Tomorrow i have a hire car and have to move to the new city, and just feel totally paralysed at the prospect of it all.

My brain is telling me my current lifestyle isn't so bad after all, that i love my parents and living with them is nice and safe, that not having a partner or friends doesn't really matter, and that i should just be getting a job nearby and stay here. 

I don't want to fail at this, but i'm worried i've made a mistake and overestimated what i could be capable of. Please help, as right now i feel like i need to be taken to hospital i feel so inconsolable and unable to cope.

"[help] [rant] Girlfriend's new male friend giving me anxiety (OCD, BPD) Okay, so here's the gist. I'm 20, she's 22, I have OCD and probably BPD as well (I show a lot of the symptoms)

My girlfriend and I both moved across the country, I was going to move out of my home state one way or another, been planning to for years after my sophomore year of college, and our relationship looked like it had a good trajectory so I basically just followed her to where we are now

She and I both don't have many connections here, and she's in a very demanding grad program so *having* connections is a must (sparing details so I don't give away too much)

Anyway, so this guy is a friend of a friend she made and she sits by him in one of her classes. He's not really a looker by any means and he seems like he's funny and interesting enough to make a decent friend. She messaged him once in response to something on social media, nbd, and then after that he started trying to make more contact with her and gradually they got closer

I felt iffy about it from the start and have caused a lot of fights over it because I can't get rid of the gut feeling that something is wrong, even though she swears up and down that she isn't attracted to him and she has no interest in him

I understand the importance of having a good friend out here but it's hard for me to rationalize developing a close connection with somebody without there being a romantic attraction. It feels like they're talking fairly often, daily for sure even though there seem to be breaks during the day, and usually late into the night and early in the morning. Like last night she was texting him while we were in bed which sucked because it was the first time we'd really ""spent"" together all day (we'd been hanging out together all day but she was studying for finals.) 

I know cheating and stuff like that is usually a symptom rather than a cause, and as far as I'm aware she loves me and things in our relationship are relatively smooth, this and occasional peripheral fights aside, so I don't believe that she's really trying to fill a void. We spend a lot of time together, I'm constantly trying to learn and improve myself and grow as a person and, essentially, remain interesting. That sort of thing.

I don't think it's ""good night"" ""good morning"" types of things, I think the conversation just doesn't really ever end, if you will. A natural succession from one topic to another and that sort of thing

Also she has social anxiety and fairly unique interests so it's rare for her to connect with somebody of either sex

Plus it's all sort of dumb because we're both pan (though we're both from a conservative state so neither of us have ever acted on it and only ever dated the opposite sex)

I'm so worried about being replaced or forgotten or having her develop feelings for someone else, especially since I know he can accommodate something I can't (since he's in the same program) and because almost every relationship I've been in has been deceptive at best or very emotionally abusive at worst

I've tried to start doing CBT and taking my medication regularly and I'm even trying to start going to a therapist (though I haven't yet) but it just nags at me

I love her immensely and genuinely want a future with her so I don't want the relationship to end, especially just because I can't get over my anxiety. I'm kinda just hoping people can talk sense into me about the nature of close relationships and how they don't always have to be romantic because my anxiety keeps clinging to that",Anxiety

We've been insanely busy the past two weeks and me calling out those two times last week put us behind schedule and we all had to work last Saturday.

I'm a early 20s male and I have developed some sort of mental issue. As the years have gone by I've become more and more angry and more alone.

I've fallen for 3 girls so far and all 3 rejected me for another guy. But that's only part of my loneliness. Now I have these overrationalizing thoughts that overwelm my brain, I've held on for so long overrationalizing every social activity and what could happen and not happen I've grown more tired. I haven't left the house in 4 days, I don't have anyone to talk to and right now it's pretty bad. I need advice what to do? Talk to a friend? Go to a psychiatrist? Take sleeping pills?

Some days it's bad, like my shoulder blades are so sore and my neck is sore and all the muscles just feel messed up, other days just slight discomfort.

"Sleep disorder due to traumatic near-ego-death A couple of years ago I had a traumatic experience involving a very large dose of LSD and some other drugs. After several years in various therapies and a habit of daily meditation I regained functioning but I still have a sleep disorder that I can't fix. I can't let go of control - when I approach the point of falling into unconsciousness in deep sleep, my fight or flight response is triggered and I wake up in panic. This is basically what happened with the LSD, I approached ego death (complete disintegration and loss of control, basically total annihilation) suddenly and without warning and severely panicked due to the other drugs involved.

If the trigger would have been something I can consciously invoke like in classic phobias then I could do exposure therapy, but my problem is that my trigger is losing control or falling into unconsciousness - I can't invoke that voluntarily and gradually apart from taking drugs (which I'm not going to).

Basically I'm stuck on survival mode. If I don't do anything except eat and sleep for a year, my sleep gets fixed and I can sleep an entire night without waking up. As soon as I do something that involves losing control, like drinking a beer or having an orgasm, I start having panic attacks in my sleep again every night.

It's not losing control itself that is directly triggering (although it does cause some heart palpitations) - I don't have a phobia from drinking or having sex and I can do those things. But once I do it even once - losing control in my sleep starts triggering panic again and I can't sleep more than consecutive 2-3 hours every night.

Can anyone recommend how to approach solving this?",Anxiety
"Panic attack while working out So I used to be on Cipralex and Carbamazepine for about nine months, but due  to some unforeseen stress, had to go back on meds. My diagnosis is apparently what you call a conversion disorder ( at least here in Russia). Plus, apparently, I have had an untreated depression and anxiety for years so that doesn't help either. 
So this time around after having paralyzed myself (literally couldn't feel my hand fucked up is that) and crying for days I went to see my doc and she got me started on clonazepam. 1/6 in the morning, and 1/4 before bed. That was good for a couple of days, until the crying spells returned. So she got me on sertraline, take 0,25 before bed. 
I know it's been only a week, and seems to me this time it's a bit easier to manage, but here's the thing, I went to gym today for a light run, and got a slight panic attack after ten minutes on elliptical. 
Anything of a kind ever happened to anybody before?

Usually, you're working out to reduce stress and all. To be fair, 1/6 of Klonopin in the morning doesn't do much for me, so I bite a little bit more during the day when I feel the tensions rising, but this though...?

"Need advice about therapy and it's frustrations First post here, need someone to talk some sense into me—

For at least the last 10 years of my life I've been dealing with what I believe are signs of anxiety and possibly some sort of panic disorder. I've had to do a lot of self healing and research to try and get a grip on this so I can live my life. Besides family and school counselors I never had the opportunity to actually seek professional help until now. This week I started seeing a therapist and I'm feeling an overwhelming amount of frustration. 

It's just that I've gotten so far in terms of trying to pinpoint what's going on and maybe what the causes are so at this point I feel like I just need a professional to kind of confirm and push me in the right direction to finally feel okay. Granted I've only met with him a couple of times but the things he's asking me to do are things I already do or have already tried to do—very generic tasks and I guess it's just not what I expected.

I'm going to do what he asks me to but am I justified in feeling like maybe there's a more direct way to deal with what's going on or am I just being impatient?

I feel like i might die if i sleep, if i eat, and dont even get me started on exercising. And i go to a psychologist and i will be starting a psychiatrist this week so i already seeked for help.

And i was kinda fine with that because i know that those are the symptoms of panic attacks but now i have them everyday all the time. Thats why im asking if anyone experiences this. Like i know its normal to have these symptoms during a panic attack or under stressful situations but this past few days i didnt even leave my house, i dont exercise, and i still have this symptoms like chest pains, shortness of breath, etc.
I went to the doctor FIVE TIMES this month bc im really worried i have something.
They did a blood test, an ekg, a stress test, and tomorrow im gonna go do another blood test bc the psychiatrist im going to see asked for It. 
so they did all these tests and they all came out perfect, thats what the doctor said and i believe It but my anxiety tells me otherwise.
The thing that really worries me is that three days ago i started having palpitations (my heart beats faster than normal also not in an irregular patern) NON STOP like all day long and my chest hurts right where my heart is and i cant breathe sometimes ?????

"I actually hate working in an office Everyone in offices are so normal. Everybody's cheery and I just stare at my screen and think about my problems. I do meditation but sometimes it's not enough to calm me down. Literally just today my managers were talking about the Christmas party in our open plan office when my immediate manager says I don't drink, to which my line manager blurts out ""seriously, you dont drink?"" for everyone sitting close to hear (I was so uncomfortable, I can't drink because of a chronic skin problem that I'm super self conscious of). Having no one to talk to about any of it really sucks ass. Everyone kind of just stares at me like I'm not supposed to be there because I'm quiet and it I just feel so trapped in this job.

"Anxiety gets the worst when my boyfriend does not respond enough. I have some solutions, but not many. My anxiety is horrific around this time. I'm in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend so our only ways of being with each other is through text and Skype until we see each other again in August. 

Right now we're both in school and working hard, but when he gets stressed, he spends his whole day studying at school until he comes home after class and we Skype. When he studies he doesn't respond for hours on end sometimes, when I am used to him responding after maybe 10 minutes at most. 

Let me make something clear though: I do not EVER blame him or get mad at him for not responding. I have never said anything to him about him not giving me enough attention or anything. When he is studying, I give him all the space he needs to focus, so I do not force him to talk to me 24/7. 

With that being said, my own mind loves to kill me. I know he is just studying, but my mind loves to take over and tell me he is sick of me and hates me and doesn't love me anymore and doesn't want to have anything to do with me. I know this is obviously not true and that he is just busy with finishing up his schooling. 

I don't know how to stop it. I always take screenshots of the sweet things he sends to me every now and then, and when I am breaking down and getting into the dark place again, I look at them to try and reassure myself. It works occasionally but only temporarily. 

I need more ways though. I need to keep the anxiety under control so I don't fall into a deep pit of despair all the time.

Any suggestions?",Anxiety
"DAE struggle to control their blushing at work? I'm having a really hard time settling into a job I started 4 months ago. I have a strong desire to socialise and make friends but I can't have a conversation with anyone without turning bright red.

It's also really hot at my workplace.

Some people make eye contact the ENTIRE time they're telling me something and it makes me so uncomfortable.

When people start a conversation by asking me an open question I instantly feel overwhelmed and under pressure. 

I feel like people remember that I am a blushy person and so I am embarrassed as soon they talk to me.

"Anxiety symptoms after hitting head So on Wednesday morning I banged my head in and around the right temple. A couple of hours after, I had to go out, but a couple of hours after I got home I started to develop some symptoms with have become more and more irritating in the shape of derealisation-esque vision as well as extreme muscle tension (although it doesn't hurt) in and around the ear area of the right side of my head which has developed further over the last couple of days.

After waking up the following morning I felt okay at first until I realised that my vision still felt detached and not focused. Since then I've fixated on my symptoms most of the time and because I've become so stressed out I decided to go to a walk-in centre for some checks. They couldn't do scans or anything there, so instead went over procedures involving my eyes, touching things infront of me with my eyes closed, following the nurse's finger, taking my blood pressure and more. She said I should be okay but it could potentially be mild concussion that is making me feel a bit off. I did also mention my anxiety.

Since then, I've still worried about my symptoms but am trying to detach myself and let myself recover. Obviously, the problem is, the symptoms I have are quite unique and although I want them to go, it's hard for me to make myself believe they're the cause of anxiety. The tension is very annoying, but the vision thing is the main thing that worries me. I can see properly in the sense that nothing around me is blurry or anything, but I just feel detached from my surrondings or whatever I'm trying to involve myself in. For example, if I'm on a video game, I feel like my vision is more centred and I have to adjust my eyes to focus on certain areas of the screen at once.

I guess what I'm asking is, has anybody else ever had similar symptoms where, because you're worried about getting those symptoms you end up forcing them into reality because you're worried? I know I probably just need to distract myself and it'll speed up my recovery but it's just so hard to involve myself in something other than my symptoms when I can't focus properly on something without saying to myself about how different my vision feels at present. Sorry for the long post, but I'd really appreciate responses.",Anxiety
"I feel like I can't even function Delete if this isn't allowed. 

The other day, I started a load of laundry and put a second load in the dryer. It wasn't in balance, and kind of shook back and forth. I got the worst feeling of impending doom and had to turn it off or else I would feel like the entire house would catch fire. I waited until my step-mom got home. 

Sitting in the car and watching other cars get too close, or driving beside a large vehicle terrifies me. I'm 23 and still don't know how to drive because I don't know how to handle things. 

When we moved into a new house, we got an oven that has a funny smell, and my head spins because I imagine we're going to suffocate from some kind of CO2 poisoning. 

I have pains randomly, and I always think the worst possible outcome. (I'm a female with health issues, so it's never fun.)

"Job is too much for me This is my first time on this sub but I'm in need of some dire help. To start I was diagnosed with social anxiety when I was 6 and was taking Zoloft up until before I turned 18. From there I, still had small panic attacks but I was usually able to keep it under control. Now I'm 19 and just got hired for a job. I started training yesterday, but after and all day today I've been nauseous and panicky. I really want to quit but I'm scared of what to say, how they'll react, etc. I haven't get like this since I started high school but now I'm damn near frozen in anxiety. What should I say/do? 


Edit: I called in and told them I quit. I know it's not good to run and hide from these things but I thought I was gonna have a damn heart attack. It was a groundskeeping job and they expected me to be able to traverse 24 square miles and know all the back ways by day 3 (I did a ride along yesterday and supposed to today). I've held other jobs fine before but for some reason when it requires memory of a bunch of things I get a panic attack.

"I want to send a letter/facebook message to people from my past to thank them, but anxiety is making me panic about it being creepy. Any advice? Hi all,

I have just finished my uni degree, and for Christmas, I wanted to send some letters/Facebook messages to people who have helped me through my time at education (my social anxiety stems from being at school/uni). However, my ***hole brain is telling me that me thanking people/ seeing how they're doing etc will seem creepy. I don't use social media, so I ,in effect, disappeared and lost contact with them. Most of them are to teachers/support staff, but two are to old classmates that I got on well with. 

I know in my heart that they probably won't feel that I'm being creepy/ wanting something from them, but I just need some convincing. I got to know them from being in the 'school support' class, so they know about anxiety/depression a bit more then most, and I don't think they would be rude about it. It would be nice to get to know them again, meet them etc. 

So, any advice for me? Have any of you done something similar, and how did it go?

"Afraid to go on vacation with friends, doesn't matter if it's a week or 2 days. Afraid I won't be able to be myself when I get exhausted after 2 days of trying my best to be ""normal"" and afraid to show my insecurities I manage to hide. This summer a bunch of friends asked me to go with them on vacation for a week. From the moment I was invited I became afraid. I always do my best to appear ""normal"" and everyone says I'm a social guy. But nobody knows that I'm exhausted after a whole day out with friends. I didn't go.

They plan to go again next year and they will definitely want me to be there with them, especially because I told them it sucked missing the trip (which is true).

I'm grateful to be surrounded with people that want me to go on a trip with them. But I'm just really anxious about stuff like that.

I'm anxious that everyone's going to see my pale skin or my slightly balding head when we go swimming. Or my acne that always visits my face on the worst moments possible (I secretly, as a guy, use a little bit of concealer whenever I have a pimple and go out, I won't be able to do this on the trip). I'm anxious that my social anxiety will get out of hand.

But worst of all, I'm anxious that I'm going to be mentally drained after a day or two and won't be the ""social guy"" anymore that they know. I manage to be okay and kind of energetic from time to time but that's only because I get enough time alone to recharge. On a vacation with a week full of drinking this simply won't be possible. I'm afraid people will find me boring after a day or two because I literally won't be as full of life as I may look most of the time.

I guess I just wanted to vent. It sucks being like this. Why can't my life just be ""normal"", such a shame to have to deal with this nonsense...

Gym class worries I'm in high school currently and have had problems with anxiety for years now. Ever since I could remember I've always been a nervous and anxious person. I especially hate having any attention drawn to me. So the main thing I have been really scared about lately is that we have a swimming unit in my gym class and I'm scared shitless by all of it. I'm terrified that people are gonna laugh at me when I take off my shirt due to my acne problems and If I wear a shirt in the pool I worry that they will laugh at me then too. I am scared people will laugh at how I swim or if I mess something up. The thing is I really shouldn't have these fears. I've never really been bullied or made fun of in general but I am always scared that it is going to happen. Even positive attention scares me because I feel like I'll somehow do something that will make people laugh at me or something. I've been trying to forget about gym class all week but I just can't.

I hadn't mentioned this to my husband, yet.  Well, tonight, I went into our bedroom and shut the door so I could meditate for a bit while my PS4 updated.  I guess he came out of his Battlefield V world long enough to notice I was missing, so he came into the bedroom and saw me cross-legged, eyes closed on the bed while a soothing voice talked me through the session on my phone.  I looked at him, smiled, and went right back into it without saying a word.  I heard him whisper to our dog, ""Come on, let's go, Mommy's doing something weird.""

"Interview/Job Stress & Anxiety   

FYI this is basically just a big rant/me unloading my thoughts that have kept me up since 4:00am! 

Today is a big day for me! My first interview in YEARS. 

Here's my situation:

For the past 4 years, I've worked as a senior administrator for a small local company. It has been a really difficult, anxiety inducing ride up until this point as, while I love my job – my boss has some serious emotional disturbances and consistently takes out their frustrations (both personal and professional frustrations) on the staff and colleagues. Essentially, if she's having a bad day – everyone else is going to have an even worse day. When she's happy/things are going well in her own life, she is very kind, generous, treats everyone with respect… but those days have become more far and few between as time goes on. It's like working for Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. 

Anyways, due to a mix of anxiety and health problems, I have worked at home for the past 1.5 years (this was a major struggle to negotiate and I'm constantly reminded of 'what a privilege' I should consider this. While it is certainly nice to be in the comfort of my own home, this is out of necessity for me. The alternative was that I was going to quit and go on disability, and when my employer realized this, she allowed me to start working from home.) 

Honestly, I thought I'd be stuck putting up with my employers abusive ways for many years to come because it is so difficult to get an at home admin job. Most people (understandably) want their admin to be physically in the office, so I've been just trying to troop through, stay strong, and remember that her actions are a reflection of her, not me… but it has been so draining and exhausting. I find anxiety drains me in the most intense way.   
 

So, here is the (hopefully) really good news. I found a job online that is essentially identical to my own, and for a local company… where all the staff WORK AT HOME! So I figured, what the hell, and applied. The owner of the business got back to me within a matter of hours and we have an interview set for 8 hours from now.

Now – to the anxious aspects of this. The owner of this business seems incredibly sweet and genuine and the job sounds GREAT! I have yet to hear anything about salary $/wage but am crossing my fingers hard that it is comparable to my current salary (I'm very, very happy with my wage right now and am paid significantly above industry standard) but after years of this draining mess with my boss, I'm going to have to accept that no amount of money is worth my mental health. Can't put a price on happiness, right? 

I'm nervous about the interview cause, well, interviews, and as much as I hope it goes well/they offer me the job, I'm TERRIFIED ABOUT PUTTING IN MY NOTICE TO QUIT MY CURRENT JOB (if I get to that point) as…. MY BOSS KNOWS THE OWNER OF THIS COMPANY. I know that if/when I put in my notice, I'm going to be screamed at, accused of 'betraying the company/my boss', etc etc. There is no way to just 'not tell her where the new job is' because I know she will not let it go and will demand to know.

It will not be a pleasant time and my boss will make my last days absolute hell, but I'm trying to look at it like – this will be the last unpleasant days/weeks/interactions with this woman.    
 

Also, the interview is in a coffee shop (so awkward, I'll get there early of course, but what do I do when she walks in? Stand up and go shake the interviewer's hand? Wait for her to wander over to me? She doesn't know what I look like so I'm going to have to take the initiative here) Hah my over active brain is ridiculous, I know.)   
 

If anyone has any tips for interviews (it's been so long!) or any ideas on how to make this day go as smoothly as possible, I'd really appreciate it. Thank you for letting me rant on! ",Anxiety
"Anger when anxious TLDR: When anxious I lash out with words no screaming just completely hurtful things and bitching to person near me, normally boyfriend. How do I prevent myself from lashing out?
Background about me: 5 diagnoses— generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, social anxiety, depression, and adhd. I have had 2 emotionally abusive boyfriends. My parents both have generalized anxiety and mom had depression and dad has social anxiety. I find my mom lashes out a lot when things don't go her way so until recently I thought it was normal and would react the same way to things

First off sorry this is so long there is just so much happening and I need help. When my anxiety starts to increase I start to get super angry, irritated, just completely rage for no reason. I feel awful because I spent almost everyday with my boyfriend of over a year and I find myself just completely snapping at him for literally nothing, I realize immediately what I'm doing is wrong and try to stop myself but I feel as if I have no control until I've completely snapped and been bitchy to the point where my anxiety was consumed but anger and I snap back to me, calm and understanding. I immediately apologize, I feel absolutely awful this happens and try so incredibly hard to avoid it. The worst part is when it happens I don't have  enough of a warning to pull myself back and talk my self through it instead of bitching. The last thing I want to do is bitch at my boyfriend, especially when he doesn't deserve it at all. He's so caring, kind, and very patient. He doesn't let it bother him but still he does not deserve it just because he can take it. I just want to know how to not snap and I was wondering if anyone deals with this with their anxiety?This has been going on forever but I only realized with him that it's not rational behavior or reasons. I see my mom lash out so I just thought it was normal. But once I've been in the receiving end from and emotionally abusive ex, my biggest fear is that it will get bad to the point where I'm emotionally abusive, it's my biggest fear and I do absolutely everything I can so I'm not. Starting last week I began slowly coming off of all my medications because I've been on medication since age 5 and am curious to see if medicine could be what's messing me up. I've been under high stress past 2 days, virus that mimics stress, vaginal issues, stomach issues, 2 jobs, and parents making it very clear they do not agree with my decision of coming off medications and my dad has made it extensively clear he will not support me at all. I just need a strong support system but the only person on my side is my boyfriend, he was enough until my whole family disagrees with me and keep trying to talk me out of it. ",Anxiety
"Would anybody agree we need more positive posts on this subreddit? Let me practice what I preach if I may...

This morning, and most mornings, I fought off an incredibly severe bout of anxiety as soon as I opened my eyes.  The rush of adrenaline and angst was nearly overwhelming.  However, I took deep breaths, caught myself, told myself everything is fine, thought of 5 things I was grateful for and one thing I was super excited about and looked forward to in the future.  Soon after that my anxiety was gone and my mind was on to other things.  I didn't give those dreadful thoughts any attention and I didn't entertain them.  I simply let them pass and subtly replaced them with positive thoughts.  I hope this can help at least one person to have a better day, or even a better moment to see that there's always a light.

"Fear of life after graduation is seriously messing me up right now I've been a student for 17 years out of the 23 years of my life. I sort of don't know anything else. In about 10 days, I start my first ever ""job"". It's an internship, unpaid, and a friend of my mother set it up for me. I realize people are giving me a chance, but I'm already too scared of it all. 

Of being an adult. I've been an adult, technically, for five years. Yet, nothing about me suggests so. I still live in the same room, sleep in the same bed, and wear the same clothes that I wore when I was in my early teens. Physically, I just have bigger boobs! Mentally, I'm much more pessimistic, anxious, and suspicious. 

I want a break from life. Like, this internship is happening too soon, and it might be too much for me if it turns out I'm supposed to be there every single day.

My mom thinks I have my shit together (which is why she helped me out). Even the guy who interviewed me thought I was awesome, but I feel like such an impostor, and somehow, I've got everyone fooled.

"Really want to start going to the gym before I get devoured by depression So I've had a pretty typical level of anxiety throughout my life. Nothing too extreme. Pretty much what you'd associate with someone who's ""shy"". The thing is, as of late (as in the last year or so), my depression has kind of ""flared up"". It's been causing me to make some bad decisions that are leading me down a dark road.

I've never once thought I would be able to step foot in a gym, and for the first time, I'm considering it. I've reached an emotional plateau and it scares me. It's also helping me find motivation in things I never could before.

"I got the job! Hi I posted two weeks ago about being nervous for a job interview. I was extremely nervous that I'd get a panic attack during it or clam up and forget how to talk. 

I wanted to post an update because not only did I get the job, but I wasn't even (that) nervous during the interview!

The method I used to prepare for it was to come up with a bunch of basic interview questions and ones I found on Glassdoor that people had been asked by this company before, and I recorded myself answering them over and over again. It was really amazing to see how much better I got and it gave me confidence that I would be able to answer the questions.

Last night was shit. Only melatonin can calm my anxious mind, but I wake up unrested from it. What the fuck should I do with this nighttime anxiety. This sleep anxiety is the worst I ever have. When I am awake, those death thoughts are not going to haunt my mind, only when I am trying to sleep. And this shit gave me insomnia and a very short, interrupted sleep during the night. 

I am fucking tired and sick of this shit called anxiety. Fuck college, fuck teachers, fuck everyone who made me stressed during the finals. I can't even eat my favorite foods right now, because too much sodium or too much carbs can fuck my mood like 1\-2\-3. ",Anxiety

I haven't used reddit for more than a couple weeks so I don't really know how this works. But, I recently started struggling quite badly with anxiety attacks and was wondering if anyone would be willing to be friends/if I was able to talk to anyone about my problems? Of course I'd love to listen to yours as well as friendship is a two way street, but none of my friends have anxiety irl nor do they care if I do or not.

"I confronted my controlling sister I live with, and even though my anxiety spiked I feel better. So quick run down, I live downstairs, we have a bathroom, and a small kitchen area with a sink, microwave and mini fridge. My sister lives upstairs, next to the kitchen, and runs it like it's her own personal restaurant. Her name is written on more than half the items in the fridge and freezer, and even when I make something that's not ""hers"", she sends me passive aggressive texts about the smell that's left over, or maybe there might be a dish in the sink. It got to the point to where I would avoid eating until she went to bed (around 11 pm), just so I could eat without the anxiety of the kitchen warden. Today she broke the camels back about a single dish left in the sink from the early morning. I defended myself, and told her that she has control issues about what should be a shared living space. She disagreed, and ended up walking away from the argument, but it felt good to stand up for myself instead of cowering like I usually do. Just wanted to share a little self triumph with you all, and I hope if you share a similar situation, that when you get the courage to confront someone or something that is causing you grief, that they will at least be understanding. I didn't get that satisfaction, but I did get to stand up for myself and for today, I count that as a win.

I've done a lot of things to him that aren't really nice and I regretted them and asked for forgiveness. But now Im blaming myself even more, and every time he feels bad I swear it passes to me and I feel even worse. 

I know my friend is trying his best to overcome his issues and looking for things to help him get to that'll recovery or at least maintain it.

"Moving 7 hours away from family and i'm having extreme anxiety Hi all. So, to elaborate a bit: I just graduated college this past June and my boyfriend just graduated with his MA. We went to college about three hours or so apart (though he is from a place only 30 minutes from me), and we have done much of college long distance, minus summers when he is home and we are able to be together. He received a great job offer seven hours away from where I currently live, and we are moving up there in the next week. I've been dreading this all summer. 


Now, look, I love my boyfriend to pieces. We've been together for six years and there is definitely a part of me that *is* excited, I can feel it sometimes, but it is way, wayyyy deep down there -- buried under all of my fear and anxiety.


I've been living at home all through college. My mom is, quite literally, my best friend. My dad passed away when I was young, so my mom, my sister, and I have developed quite a strong bond. (My sister married and moved out about two-three years ago, so it's just been me and my mom lately). My mom has also spent most of this year undergoing surgery and doing chemotherapy for cancer she was diagnosed with. All she has left is a bilateral mastectomy and she's done (yay!). Problem is, I'm moving two days after her surgery. I'm basically just terrified of moving. I love her to death. I love being so close to her and all of my family (my sister is close, other family and friends are close as well). The thought of moving so far away just absolutely scares me. I don't like not having any sort of support system up there, plus my anxiety/depression makes it difficult for me to be social. I have to get a job up there and I'm scared -- I really juts want to find some sort of remote/telecommute job so that I am able to visit home more easily, especially if my mom needs me. I just don't know what to do. I feel as if I'm constantly having anxiety attacks and crying about the whole. My boyfriend understands, and agrees that after a year or two we will do our best to move back down near my family, but right now we are in a 14-month lease and he has to stay at his job for at least a year in order to keep his benefits. 


My last fear is that when I first started college, I went away to a school a couple hours away. It didn't go well, and I ended up coming home after the first quarter. I had extreme anxiety and had medical issues as a result. I know that I've matured and worked on my anxiety a lot since then, but I still have those same deep-rooted anxieties and fears about moving away, and now also worrying that the same thing will happen again. I also realize that living in my own place with my boyfriend is a lot different than living in a dorm with strangers who drink to excess and bother me. 


Does anyone have any tips on how to get through this? How to deal with feeling so scared about moving so far away from everything I know and love? I know I'll be with my boyfriend and he'll do whatever he can to make me comfortable, but with my anxiety and OCD-tendencies, I get worried about how things will go. I also hate flying alone, so that is an issue (though I would do my best to get over it, of course!). I'm just freaking out, and I could really use any advice possible. I need to be able to do this and prove to myself that I can move away and thrive, but I just have a really hard time believing that I can do that. Everything is just so stressful and nervewracking for me.Even the thought of driving up seven hours with my car full of all of my stuff worries me. Thanks in advance, and sorry if this is huge jumble of things, it's been hard to write down how I'm feeling!",Anxiety
"Sugar/stimulants seem to make things way worse for me So I've probably dealt with ocd like symptoms all my life but intense anxiety didnt show up until like 6 years ago when I was 18. Throughout the years I've noticed a pretty big correlation between high amounts of sugar and caffiene or other stimulants make it much worse. If i can get the right mindful attitude plus reduce/cut out sugar and caffiene I'm a completely different person. 

Still have some anxiety, but it's reduced to the point where it doesn't completely incapacitate me. Just thought I'd mention it if you haven't tried that yet. 

I'm not trying to say it's the root cause, but just that it makes it much easier to spiral out of control, at least for me.

"Has anyone ever had a coworker give them extreme anxiety to the point where it makes you question yourself? I don't want to make this a superfluous and congested post, but I started a new job a few months ago that on the whole I enjoy. However, I never expected that simply one employee could drag me down to the point where I dread wanting to go to work.

This guy is just so hard to describe without experiencing it, but he's one of those extremely loud, hyper extroverted guys who's totally unaware of himself. He'd terribly invasive and makes me feel extremely guilty. Examples are things such as him prodding me every single day about what I did over the weekend or trying to hang out (which I would never because he sucks), making fun of me or pointing things out that I do or don't do in front of others, commenting on my mood, over sharing his personal life and sex life... The list goes on. He always tries to prod heavily into my personal life. It's draining. Meanwhile, he's perfect at sucking up to upper management and is pretty good at his job so they don't see the side that I see. I'm not entirely sure how others feel about him because I need to be careful about making my opinions known, so I don't ask around alot.

Anyways, I'm just curious how people have handled problematic employees like this. I've never felt this way at a job and it's at the point where I'm having like a legitimate identity crisis and questioning my self worth because of his commentary and how bad he makes me feel on a daily basis. I used to be able to brush this stuff off but lately I'm just overwhelmed because I am running out of patience to fake my moods everyday when he irritates me. ",Anxiety
"Anxiety and being codependent So, I've been struggling with my anxiety lately, having panic attacks more often. Usually, I turn to my partner, but I'm afraid I might bother them sometimes. Moreover, when they're tired, they can be a bit rough. Not at me or about me, but with their language and it makes my anxiety worse. I'm afraid of talking to them about it, because it makes me feel like I'm too sensitive. 

I'd like to not be this dependent on them, but I don't know how to get started. I hate being alone, and it's unrealistic to say I can be around other people all the time. I also dislike talking to people about my anxiety, so this doesn't help. 

How can I learn to be more independent? ",Anxiety
"I'm finally about to make some progress! Ready to share my story! So a little backstory on me: I've been suffering from anxiety for as long as I can remember. I've always been the anxious one, the one who overthinks, the one who worries. The first time anyone told me I could have an anxiety disorder was 7 years ago when my anxiety graduated into full-blown panic attacks. I was in college at the time, and I convinced myself that I had something wrong with my heart and after multiple tests and doctors' appointments, I was told I could have an anxiety disorder and I was given a leaflet on how to deal with panic attacks.


Now, that didn't help me, and I spent the next couple of years pretending to be fine and hiding my true emotions. The panic attacks tapered off but I still carried around a lot of anxiety. 4 years after that initial 'diagnosis', I started having panic attacks again. By this point, I was working full time and had left home the year previous. Again, the doctors were not helpful and I was given a week's sick note and told to have some time off. What commenced was one of the worst week's in my life. I spent it sitting around overthinking and making myself worse. The guilt of having to take time off from work at such short notice ate me up inside. Also during this time, I noticed people's behaviour towards me changing. Suddenly I was this fragile little doll and people either were super careful around me, watching everything they said in my presence and constantly watching me, or they kept their distance. It still hurts to this day to look back and remember how alone I felt during that week and the several weeks that followed.


A year later, I'm still not better. During a routine medication review (I was on the pill), my boyfriend (who is also my best friend and an absolute angel during this whole process) and I decided that I should try yet again to get some help and see if they could anything for me this time. (Side note: this would be the 3rd different doctor I would speak to about my anxiety). While the doctor was lovely, the only thing she could recommend was talking therapy (CBT) over the phone. Now, CBT works for a lot of people, and I know it's a great way to deal with anxiety, but the talking therapy offered to me did not help. My 'therapist' was rude and the phone calls often triggered more anxiety, and on one occasion a full blown panic attack. I was dismissed from the treatment after missing two appointments (the first one was because my phone network was down and the call didn't come through, and the second was because I couldn't make the appointment, so rang a day before to reschedule, was told someone would get back to me and they never did). That was 2 years ago.


Feeling I had exhausted every avenue, I decided to keep my feelings to myself. I stopped opening up to my family and let the anxiety build up inside of me. Two weeks ago, the panic attacks started again. I've lost count of how many I've had over this fortnight, but I've been in a constant state of despair and dread. After constantly breaking down and having these attacks, I decided to tell my family last week. To say they have been supportive is an understatement. My mother convinced me to ring the doctor's again and she insisted on coming with me. 

My appointment was this morning and I finally think I'm about to make some progress. I was diagnosed with a half-dose of antidepressants for a couple of weeks, and I was given some advice that I could have used 7 years ago. There is no way the nurse practitioner I spoke to will read this, but I want to say thank you to her. Thank you for listening to me and not blowing me off. Also, thank you to my boyfriend and family for being there, for understanding and being a shoulder to cry on. For the first time in what feels like forever, I feel optimistic and I'm looking forward to the future.

"Need help making friends and starting relationships Hey everyone,

Sorry for the long post, but here it goes (TL;DR at the very bottom):

I'm an undergraduate sophomore (20 year old, male) entering the spring semester. I've been feeling isolated and lonely lately, mainly because I've never had close friends or romantic relationships in my entire life. My freshman year, I joined two clubs, both having a lot of people, but I struggled to make friends there. I left those clubs, b/c they added to my work load and stress, and no one was interested in talking to me (even after I made an effort to talk to some people). After that, I joined chess club, and I have fun while I'm there. The people are nice, but I'm struggling to make close friends.

I have general anxiety/social anxiety (for as long as I can remember). I saw a psychiatrist a few weeks ago, and he prescribed me a medication (escitalopram). To describe my thoughts.. I can't approach a cashier without feeling awkward/self-conscious. I'm too anxious and uncomfortable to initiate contact with people in my lectures, my professors, or people sitting in libraries/cafés for fear of inconveniencing them or looking like a loner/loser. Whenever I walk by a large group of people on the other side of the sidewalk, I feel extremely self-conscious and feel like breaking down (i.e. crying) at any moment. In my freshman-year clubs, whenever there was a social scene after practice at someone's house, I was too nervous to ask for a ride (I was scared to inconvenience a teammate to drive me). It's a great struggle for me to initiate contact with the average student or professor, even to ask a question.

It's strange. I WANT to meet new people and form relationships (both friendships and intimate ones), but at the same time, I can't get myself to do it. I feel very tense/anxious/self-conscious when approaching someone (ANYONE) and starting a conversation and keeping it. The constant self-consciousness and blushing/reddening whenever I talk to someone is driving me insane. It's annoying to have this happen, even when I'm doing something as simple as ordering coffee. I can't even look a cashier in the eye. I've tried and failed many times (I look away after ONE SECOND of eye contact, and my face blushes a little.... doesn't matter who the cashier is and what s/he says or does).

I want to change. I don't like living this way, and I'm open to any and all suggestions/advice. I'm getting counseling in 2 weeks, but that aside...... what else should I do?

Thank you for reading!!!!
TL;DR 20 year old guy in college, never had friends or intimate relationships in my life, struggling to talk to people (fellow students, professors, etc.) out of anxiety, despite WANTING to meet new people.

"Fear and anxiety over my boyfriend So a little backstory, I was widowed June 2017 to suicide. I started dating again this sitting and meet and started dating a really nice guy in May. We've been together for 3 months now. He's been awesome and things have been going pretty well. But everyday I'm not with him is really hard and I get really bad anxiety. But it hasn't been too bad since we aren't away from each other very long. this week is extra hard he left town for the weekend and I haven't seen him in 6 days and it's awful. I keep having intruding thoughts that he doesn't like me anymore, that he's getting tired of me, that he doesn't want to see me anymore. 
Last week one day he didn't text me all day when he usually sends me something during the day and it literally sent me into a tailspin of anxiety... like panic attack levels, but when I sent him a text  he responded immediately.
And there isn't anything really wrong, he calls me everyday, texts me everyday. Responds when I send him a text, usually right away, but never longer then 2 hours. When I'm with him he's affectionate and attentive.

"Fighting the good fight - I am not alone, neither are you. Hi all,

Basically I'm doing this because I feel the need to share my anxiety with others. I don't know why I've suddenly had the urge, but I really feel the need to share this with people who actually understand.

My anxiety started after my best friend died. She was sixteen and had leukaemia. I was fifteen and it ruined my life. After a lifetime of bullying and an extremely abusive childhood, she was my solace. When she died, depression and anxiety took hold and I thought they'd never let go. After years of medication and counselling, my depression has subsided. I still struggle but I feel alive for the first time in my life. The anxiety however, has never gone and I have had to accept it may never. I mostly suffer health anxiety and severe claustrophobia. I had a blood clot in my leg a few years ago as a result of my contraceptive pill and the consequences to my mental health were catastrophic. A year before the blood clot, I had been in the room when my grandmother had died of a stroke. These together destroyed me. I was also in an abusive relationship at the time which ended when my ex-boyfriend left me for a nude model he got pregnant. They lasted a week. This was followed by a year and a half of us on-and-offing, all the time I was getting worse. During this year and a half, I was also then the victim of a serious sexual assault. With a lot of work and more time, things started to get better, but alas, my anxiety attacks have returned with a vengeance. And honestly, every single time they happen I know objectively they are not going to hurt me but it feels like I am dying. Every single time, it feels like I am dying. I am convinced I am dying.

But I never do. Because anxiety won't kill me. I refuse. It won't take my life away. It won't end my life, and it will not compromise the quality of my actual living.  I will get better again and it will come back again, hitting harder than before. And I will be ready. It will hit harder, but so will I. Anxiety is real and it is strong, but I am stronger. And I AM NOT ALONE. Sure, I know few people in my personal life who can relate to me, but I have found a community of people here who understand my struggles and who validate my experience with the issue. I have a GP who is extremely understanding (which never happens with mental illness in Ireland), an incredible and supportive boyfriend and I am taking steps to be better. And honestly, this forum is a lifeline. This community is my community. We have each other and we know what it's like. I know what it's like to feel like I'm dying, I know what it's like to live in fear of my own mind. But I am not alone.

So thank you all, for sharing your stories, your advice, your milestones.

My next big trial is coming next month, I am taking an 11 hour transatlantic flight. And I am absolutely petrified. But I will do it.

And I will survive it. Because I am a survivor. We all are.",Anxiety
"Thinking about a weighted blanket? Do it! It worked wonders for me! I've suffered from anxiety for a long time, but have been formally diagnosed with GAD about 2 years ago.

27/F and I've always had a very nervous disposition \- even to the point where my family and teachers used to call me the safety police because I couldn't let anyone do things that I deemed unsafe. In hindsight, those were totally unrealistic standards to set \(things like not allowing my 6 year old sister go down the stairs without holding my hand\). 

Either way, I started seeing my GP for my anxiety about 2 years ago and was finally actually diagnosed, so he started me on Citalopram. I came back from a 2 week long trip to India and was feeling really good, but I brought back a parasite and that did not go over well. I had the biggest panic attack of my life, and my irrational fears got worse \- I couldn't stop thinking of my SO getting hurt, my grandfather or parents getting hurt or dying, or of something terrible happening to those I care about.

My doctor was hesitant to up my dosage of Citalopram, and I really wanted to find a way to not rely on pharmaceuticals to eliminate my anxiety. He recommended acupuncture \[side note \- acupuncture has forced me to relax while I'm there, it's a great therapy, but it's only temporary\] and a weighted blanket.

I purchased one \(Gravid, 15lbs\) shortly after and as soon as I got it, I was a little disappointed.

I could sit under it and it was cozy, yes, but I didn't feel inherently more calm or relaxed.

Fast forward to the next couple mornings where I kept waking up... refreshed? It was more that I noticed I wasn't dragging my feet in the morning as much, and my anxiety was lessening every day. The more I slept under it, the more I found I would sleep through the night, my nightmares were dramatically reduced and I just felt better.

Now, I don't find I spiral out of control. If I have a scary thought or one of my fears pops into my head \(which still happens multiple times a day\) I can very easily identify it as irrational and use breathing techniques and even internal mantras to calm myself. I think that good night's sleep \(in a chain, especially!\) has changed my level of anxiety and better prepared me for the day to deal with the anxiety that is inevitably a part of me.

TL:DR \- I was struggling with anxiety on pharmaceutical treatments and wanted to quit the drug, my weighted blanket makes me sleep much more efficiently and I wake up refreshed enough to better cope with my anxiety throughout the day. 

If you're thinking of getting one, please try it! Many companies offer a full money back guarantee within a couple weeks if it's not working for you.

The work is easier than the dayjob I picked up after quitting, it has better prospects, better pay, can work from home, etc. Hypothetically this was my dream job since graduating. Realistically, a series of unfortunate events drove a deep pillar of anxiety into the work right out of the gate. Very much a fluke, but it happened anyway, and now I literally can't stand to think about the work. I can't plan, I can't communicate, I can't keep track of what I need to be doing, and most importantly I can't sit down and do the work without wanting to immediately get up and cut all contacts and just drive far far away. Every day I work on it I think this is getting worse, and no amount of me-time or coping mechanisms can do anything about it, but my subconscious would rather have me jump in front of a bus than work on this. I've been fucking up the project so badly at this point I'm expected to get pulled aside any day now, and that's not paranoia because it's already happened several times.

I don't know what to do. The list of anxiety-fighting supplements, medications, strategies, etc, that I've tried in the months after quitting and in the months after being hired back on ... is longer than this post. I would literally rather work a dead-end job that's physically punishing and boring as fuck with worse pay and shittier coworkers, which I am as my 2nd job. I'd rather have that one fulltime. There's no thinking required, no surprises, no drama, no communications, no deadlines, no schedules, no nothing. I show up and do physical labor, go home, and it doesn't follow me.

I've been getting DPDR episodes, I woke up one morning and immediately started crying for several hours, I've been very tempted to do drugs to cope, and I've been just going to bed earlier and earlier and being horribly depressed that I wake up and am still me still here still with these very simple obligations I would have been very happy to have over a year prior. It's like I've hit a critical-mass of unhappiness with my life that I can no longer muster the effort to change things and overcome the smallest of challenges. I don't enjoy anything anymore, I don't socialize anymore, I just seem to suffer over literally nothing.

I just don't understand. It doesn't make sense.

I went to college for this job. I went tens of thousands of dollars into debt for this job. I can't back out of this.",Anxiety
Is this an anxiety thing? So I just don't get ridiculously excited for like 96% of things that happen in my life. Things people find funny like just standard jokes most of them I don't react like everyone does I just think about it and know it should be funny but it just doesn't cause the reaction I used to have when I was younger. I do still have those actually laughing reactions on ocassion but it's not like it used to be. Is this a thing?,Anxiety
"S.O. has projected anger at me I realize this is a normal event for most people, but given our relationship, this is not a normal event. She's been very understanding and patient with me, but yesterday she exploded at me for no reason. We're currently going through runs of communication, but her explanation was ""it was a nicotine fit, I'm sorry.""

This has been happening more and more and my psychiatrist had advised me about ""avoiding being friends with bears"" due to being abused as a child, and I really need guidance to help figure out if I need to go that route or really try to figure out if there's a way to reconcile and keep on living as life partners.",Anxiety
"Day 25: What's Something Nice You Did For Yourself Yesterday? Wow guys! We've only got 5 days left in our challenge! Where has the time gone?

Today's question is pretty simple. I want to know what you did to be kind to yourself yesterday.

I've been away from home for a month, and yesterday I got the chance for an hour long phone call with my family (including the dog, who woofed. I'm pretty sure that was Dog for 'MOOOOM I MISS YOU.'). The SO and I also went out to this rather amazing sushi place. It was nice, but still rather low-key, which I prefer.

"Can't stand having to be caught in the middle of familial tension My parents are having some difficult issues right now and I can feel the tension whenever I'm in the same room with one or both of them.

"Why do I still have social anxiety when I'm on my max dosage of Zoloft? I've been taking Zoloft since March. I've noticed definite improvement with how much more clear my mind is. And also, even though I take 60mg of Adderall a day for my ADHD, I'll usually get sleepy at 10:30/11, and even if I'm in my bed and staring at my laptop I'll fall asleep within 10-20 minutes.

​

I've been on the 200mg dose for.... maybe 3 months now? 

​

And the thing is, I really haven't noticed a difference from 100 or 150 mg (I was on 150mg only for a brief period). 

​

And I still have pretty massive social anxiety and it's soooo annoying because I want to be more relaxed and outgoing. I've even been making sure my body is relaxed, I give myself massages with a device every week or so, etc. :(

"What to do when someone else is triggering your anxiety? So I'm posting on this eye forum. Probably spending too much time there. I'm worried about my eyesight. The problem I have is that there's this user on there who makes me more anxious. Mainly because her anxiety is worse than mine in many ways. She think she's helping, but she's really not. That forum isn't heavily moderated, so obviously can't go to the mods. Maybe I should just stop visiting that forum. Not many other users care about me and I usually just hear from her. ",Anxiety

I'm terrified and I am in a lot of distress just thinking about it. My parents, teachers and friends don't know about my social anxiety (I haven't been able to get diagnosed because my parents don't believe in it but my behaviour is extremely similar to the symptoms of social anxiety). I've been in this situation multiple times but I can't take it anymore, I would go as far as to injure multiple seriously to avoid going in front. 

What should I do??

I'm fucked Took me 5 years of having PTSD to finally realize I have no future ahead of me. I woke up realizing I might have to skip my third semester of college due to my anxiety. If I continue down this path I will most likely drop out and end up on the streets by the time I'm 30. Both of my parents recently stopped supporting me because they are just tired of dealing with it so now I just have to put on a fake smile and act like everything is ok. Truth is I have no idea how the hell I'm going to get my life together. ,Anxiety
"Need to quit job at small office - really anxious FYI this is a big anxiety rant. I recognize that I just need to put in my two weeks and get over it.

So I have given my job in a small office a fair shake. I am the newest hire and have been there for a year and a half. I was promoted to a new position a few months ago. I think they promoted me because they know I'm a good worker, but I really sucked in my initial position (only because of lack of training btw). My promotion was just my boss trying to find a better fit for me on the team. The person that had my current position was fired due to poor work performance....I'm starting to see it wasn't her fault.

I like everyone I work with and the work it self isn't so bad. I need to quit because it has gotten extremely busy (successful) and there is not enough of us to complete the work. There is hardly any training or resources to help get through the enormous workload either, which I need desperately because I am new. I don't know what the hell i am doing and feel like I am drowning everyday.  We are always in panic mode. We for sure need more people hired, but my boss won't budge and recently complained that we aren't getting enough business (what??!!!). 

 My co-workers are all unhappy, but seem to be loyal to this company and will never quit.  I feel like I suck at my job due to the lack of training and because I'm not willing to stay and work 10 hour days like my co-workers. I pride myself on doing a good job and think I'm fairly sharp and learn quickly. It's driving me insane that I can't do a good job. I ask a lot of questions and need help all the time, but honestly it's not enough. I can tell I'm getting on my supervisor's nerves because she's busy as hell too. 

My disappointment and constant stress with my job has me so exhausted that I don't even workout anymore; something I used to do a lot. I just want to nap when I get home. 

I also have a feeling I will be reprimanded soon due to my poor work performance :( 
*Just to give you an idea: I work for a mortgage lender and I'm pretty sure my incompetence has caused a few loans to almost not close at this point. Obviously something is very wrong and I need to leave.

Most of my anxiety with leaving is that I will screw over the team. If I put in my two weeks, no one is going to be happy for me.  I'm not getting any references out of this job because of this. There is only 12 people in our office and even though I suck, I'm still a body doing a portion of the work. I feel horrible leaving because I generally like everyone, but I am also resentful that none of them will be happy for me. 

This job isn't even what I went to school for, but my friend was able to hook me up when I was struggling to find a job. I really hoped that I would end up liking the job a lot and just stay forever. On the other hand, when I first started i figured if I ended up not wanting to stay forever, at least I would get some references out of the experience. Nope, not going to happen. Working with my friend has been a nightmare as well and hurt our friendship. Basically, I am realizing that since I am around her all the time now she has extreme low self esteem covered up by heavy narcissism. Being around her a lot worsens my own anxiety issues. I mostly avoid her at work and we are not very close anymore. So I don't even want to use her as a reference. She will resent me leaving too btw. My resume is currently lacking references for sure :(

I'm anxious about interviewing for other jobs of course too. That's stressful in it's self. But also finding the time to send out my resume and schedule interviews. I work 8:30-5 and know that I am going to have a hard time scheduling outside of that. 

Sorry for this post being rant-y, but I just had to get this all out. Thank you if you read the whole post! I know quitting is just something that I have to deal with, but any advice or words of encouragement would be appreciated :)",Anxiety
"Can't stop controlling my breathing. I don't understand what this is or why it is happening. I have no idea how to fix it or just endure/live with it..

I had a bad reaction to a medication, which resulted in a panic attack and severe shortness of breath. I noticed my breathing and then suddenly began controlling it. I haven't been able to stop for over a month now.

I've received a few replies of people stating they have had it too and that it went away, but I cannot just see it going away. My mind wants hyperfocus on my breathing and it becomes unnatural and forced. The problem is.. I don't mean to do this. I keep trying to distract away from it, but it's very hard. I have small moments where I am able to distract away, like when I am eating or having a conversation, but it doesn't last long..

I cannot live like this, it's all I can think about. I know that physically I am fine and I know that the body will always breathe on it's own, because I sleep fine and my body takes over, also in moments of distraction.

It just feels so uncomfortable and I have no idea how much to inhale or exhale, it's like I have to think about it and I just don't want to. I know that I can do deep breathing through my diaphragm and I do, but I don't want to have to focus on breathing all day, everyday.

Why the hell is my brain working like this? Can it be fixed without the aid of medication? It's so hard to care about anything else.",Anxiety
"Sleep anxiety I'm not sure if this belongs here, I can remove it if so, but it's 3 am and Im all alone and covered in sweat. I was kind of paralyzed in my bed for the past... Hour? Couple minutes? God knows how long. It was probably the most terrifying thing ever.

I was sleeping but I was also aware. It was like my mind was tricking me over and over again into thinking I could wake up from this weird state of consciousness but I couldn't. Like being trapped just beneath the surface of water. 

It was the weirdest thing but not scary in itself. It only ever happened to me once before months ago but this was much, much much worse than that time. 

I kept trying to wake myself up again and again because I knew I was dreaming, but every time I got close to the surface of consciousness I was pulled back under. Like my mind was repeatedly trapping itself. 

First I was tossing and turning so badly (in my nightmare?) trying to wake up because I knew something was wrong. I kept falling out of bed and I would ""wake up"" only to have the process repeat. Each successive time it got worse and worse.

I can't really describe it. I was ""falling"" into sleep. I would jerk awake only to realize I was still in my dream and *that* was my nightmare.

Last time this happened I was able to break the cycle much much sooner. This felt like it would never end. I know it's bizarre and it doesn't even sound scary but it's like being stuck in a scary part of your mind that doesn't want you to leave. It's more terrifying than any nightmare I've ever had. 

My question is, has this ever happened to anyone before? How do you stop it? The last time was months ago. This time seemed to last much longer. I don't want it to happen every again. Scared to go back to my bed now ;(",Anxiety
"Anxiety really bad, don't know what to do So my anxiety has gotten out of control the past week or so. My Dr is zero help, before I moved they were kind of helpful and would at least give me some Ativan so I could get through it. They refuse here. And I don't have a therapist or psychiatrist. 

I had some blood pressure issues after my baby was born in December but it has leveled out except for when I'm anxious it's high. I'm still on meds which are terrible and make me feel like shit but I have to wean so slow to avoid anxiety and bp spikes.

"Bad panic symptoms past 2 weeks. Any suggestions would be awesome. I'll try to make this a short story. Im February I stopped drinking alcohol. I drank about 4 or 5 times a week, enough to get a buzz for 3 years. I had 2 bad panic attacks in my first 10 days off alcohol. I ended up at the ER during the 2nd one. They didn't check anything but gave me an Ativan. Went to the Dr few days later. They gave me a script for Ativan which I took maybe 5 or 6 times during panic episodes. This was all in February. I had some issues coming off the ativan, mainly some sensitivity in my vision and hearing. I adjusted to that and had been okay up until 2 weeks ago. I had a bad panic attack out of the blue(which I think may have been triggered by Monster Energy drinks). I haven't been quite right since that night. 90% of the time I have a baseline anxiety feeling, nerve pressure, head pressure, and I just can't shake it. I've got numbness in random places.

"I suffer from severe social anxiety and today I made had a huge accomplishment! I was diagnosed around age 12 with severe social anxiety and chronic depression . I was medicated for a long time but around my junior/senior year of high school I stopped taking my medications because I convinced myself I didn't need them. I have struggled for the past 2-3 years of my life with constantly trying to balance my own unpredictable emotions and only recent decided to swallow my own pride and try medication once again. 

For a while now I've really had a downfall in my mental health to the point of losing dear friends and relapsing into self harm. After finally reaching out and finding help I'm starting to see slowly day by day a healing process beginning in my life. I have mended family relationships and I'm slowly trying to push myself every day to better my life whether it's talking to people I wouldn't normally or going to job interviews or simply speaking the truth about things I would normally push away to avoid being a burden. And today for the first time in my young adult life I truly saw my own social potential. After letting the medications take effect (over the course of several months) I have seen an increase in positive feelings and behavior as well as an increase in my own self confidence. Maybe it's the placebo effect and if so i honestly am okay with that because at least something is changing. And tonight for the first time I saw real changes. I had enough confidence and belief in myself to go to not just one person but 8 different coworkers and planned a group dinner by myself. Not only that but I went to the restaurant early and got a table by myself and was able to sit at a giant empty table in the middle of the restaurant for 15 min while waiting for the first person to arrive without having a panic attack. And at the end of it all every person found the time to tell me it was one of the best things they had done since working at this place and told me to make it a regular thing and thanked me for putting it together. As a person who spent my entire life unable to order my own food without crying mentally shutting down and causing myself physical illness due to hyperventilating I'm so ecstatic that I was able to put myself out there and conquer my own fears and anxieties and had one of the best nights I've had in a long time. And not only that I was also able to build friendships I wouldn't have been able to create without stepping outside of my own comfort zone. I don't know if it's truly my medications or simply The placebo effect but I'm really happy and proud of myself for what I accomplished tonight and I hope this goes to show people like me that it's possible to be vulnerable and sometimes it's even beneficial and you will survive it even if it seems scary.

"I was doing just fine... Hi all!  Just found this subreddit while Googling about anxiety, so I figured I'd share something that happened to me today.

I've been Prozac for anxiety for a little while now (not sure how long) and my anxiety symptoms have been relatively under control.  I hadn't had a panic attack in months, and all in all I seemed to be doing okay.

However, tonight I had a panic attack.  It wasn't as bad as some of them have been, but it was still pretty scary.  I was just at my computer, minding my own business when I started to feel a little dizzy - and then all at once it hit.  It lasted for maybe 5-10 minutes.  Thinking about it now makes me feel like another one could come on just as suddenly and easily.  I'd really rather not have anymore, and I'm hoping this doesn't mean that the medication is losing its effectiveness because it's been SO helpful up to this point.

Anyway, just wanted to share that.  Talking (typing?) about it makes me feel better.  Take care, everyone.",Anxiety

"The Girl I Like Suffers from Anxiety and She's Pushing Me Away Hey everyone! So, I matched with this girl on Tinder about 6 weeks ago. She's kind of an awful texter so it took 3 separate conversations over the course of a week before she finally told me to add her on snap and gave me her number. We had a number of in-depth snap conversations, trading videos and memes and stuff, and we would talk basically every day about tattoos we wanted to get, music we liked, and just life in general. So about 2 weeks ago, we were both back from break and I decided to finally ask her to hang out – honestly not even for a hookup or anything, because I could tell she wouldn't be into that sort of thing. I kind of pussyfooted around it and did the: ""I'm staying in this weekend and I'm gonna cook some stuff and watch movies if you're interested."" She left me on read for like 8 hours and apologized profusely because she had taken a midterm, and had sorority stuff to take care of. She said that she was really busy that weekend with relay for life, university welcome day stuff, and dinner plans on Sunday. She was free on Saturday night but was planning on staying in, so I told her that the invitation still stands if she's interested.

Fast forward another week – we were talking even more this week, including stuff about how she sees a therapist for anxiety and depression stemming from stuff with her mom – and I decided to be more assertive and clear, so I asked her to hang out like: ""Hey I want to go out with you this weekend. It's going to be really nice out so I was planning on going shopping downtown and then making some dinner at home. Want to come with?"" So, she responded: ""Hi if I were to do this to myself I would want to murder myself but I promised to go out on Friday, then on Saturday I have to get headshots done, host an event and go to a social. All of that's still tentative because I've felt awful this week. I had blood work done today and I should know the results by the weekend, but if I still feel this bad over the weekend I might fly home and see my doctors there I don't even know. But seriously shopping downtown sounds like so much fun. I am so shitty at last minute plans because I plan my weeks in advance and it freaks me out to make last minute plans and sometimes I just want to take the time for myself and ahsjdfgkshd hffhke my life is a mess. Please don't be mad at me."" I knew that she had anxiety but I had always thought that she keeps it well-hidden and has a lot of control over it (considering she's in a large sorority). So, I just responded with: ""hahaha no I totally get it. Don't let me or anybody else stand in the way of your health. I had a rough week so I might just stay in on Saturday to be honest. In which case, if you're not feeling up for your Saturday plans, the dinner invitation still stands. I promise a stress-free environment."" To which she replied: ""hahahaha thank you.""

We continue talking every day, especially on Easter Sunday where we swapped Catholic school stories. So, on Monday of this week, 5 days after the last time I asked, I decided to tell her again: ""Hey, so I really want to go out with you at some point before the semester ends. We're both busy during the week and I know you like to plan things in advance, so just let me know when you're free and I will make it work. P.S. – Listen to the new Kacey Musgraves record. You'll love it."" She responds with: ""omg I listened yesterday it's gorgeous. Also, The Weeknd posted his SoundCloud singles on Spotify!! I'm sorry for avoiding the scheduling question right now but I'm doing a lab and I am very stressed at the moment."" I responded: ""That's totally fine – I get it. Like I said, I'm willing to make whatever work, so just let me know what works for you when you get a minute.""

She never answered that, but we snapped back and forth on Tuesday about an interview I had had. A couple of hours later and she sends me a video of her in a very sexy jumpsuit and I just responded ""woooowww 😍"". After that, it's been radio silence. She celebrated a friend's birthday that night, then yesterday I snapped her once just to keep our streak going but heard nothing back. She went out again to celebrate last night and again nothing. I sent a mass snap this morning and still no response. Did I do something wrong here? Or is this just some manifestation of her anxiety and that's why she's pushing me away? I do like her, and I think she knows that, but we haven't even met yet, so it's not like this is love. Because I have minimal skin in the game, all of my instincts are telling me to turn on my heels and just walk away, but I know I would be remiss if I didn't at least tell her exactly what I'm thinking. But I also think that if I forced this conversation while she was still ignoring me/pushing me away, it would be wildly unproductive and possibly detrimental, so I'm not sure what to do here. Does anybody have any ideas of how to proceed? Just based on my own experiences with people who suffer from anxiety, I know that reassurance and clarity are really important, but I'm not sure that this is the time for that, all things considered.

Would I notice an irregular heartbeat the first time I took it? My thinking is if I don't have it then maybe I am fine in the future. ",Anxiety

Nature is so cruel to the hypochondriac Seriously how are the symptoms of actual heart problems (the number one killer of americans) and anxiety the exact same? How come the symptom for a panic attack cant be something super obvious like my tongue turns green or something,Anxiety
"back from honeymoon with my anxiety I thought i'd finally shaken my anxiety after getting married and going on my honeymoon. The lead up to my marriage was fine, although I was expecting an attack, I never got one and was actually excited for once. Went on our honeymoon for a week and had the best time, and again not a single attack. The moment I got off the plane and my phone went off, there is was. Maybe it was the ""back to reality"" thought, but having that break from panic attacks, constant worry over nothing or the unknown was a breath of fresh air. Thing is, I cant remember what I did on holiday that gave me that break! I felt excited for the future, I had business and work ideas which was refreshing. Has anyone had a similar experience? How did you get back into the mindset of not worrying about every little thing (most of which hasn't even happened and probably never will)!!! ",Anxiety
"Do you get really anxious before and after an event? I went to volunteer for an event. I got really anxious before the event. I also am still anxious after the event. Like I'm still running it through my head and thinking about it even though its the next day. Although luckily I didn't feel that much anxiety during the event. It seems to be anticipatory anxiety before the event and thinking about it a lot. And post-event anxiety.

 I had to socially interact with people when volunteering, so before the event I was always thinking that negative interactions might occur where clients would yell or ask me hard questions. Fortunately, nothing really bad happened during the volunteering event. But I still am running my socializing and interacting with people through my head. I'm not use to interacting with a lot of people in a short span of time so it does take a lot of energy out of me. Sorry if this doesn't sound clear, it's hard to express.",Anxiety
"my anxiety over flying my flying anxiety has only gotten worse in my life. i've flown on probably 100s of flights but in the last 5-10 years it's become a real struggle. i do it, but so full of anxiety and discomfort. and of course i realize it's ridiculous to be fearful as its INSANELY safe and nothing to worry about. but i'm just being irrational. it even limits me cuz i'd love to travel more and see new places but i refrain from flying unless i have to. i tried Ativan on my last flight and it seemed to truly work. i was shocked. but i'm still having anxiety to take the next flight whenever that may be. i need to overcome this and move on and do things i wanna do, such as travel...

"Internship over the summer gave me a ton of anxiety, and was a ton of BS. I'm a 21M in college, and had an internship over the summer where I essentially sat in an office all day. It was a nonprofit organization in a rural part of the state. There were three (full time!) interns including my self, and two employees. From the beginning of the internship, our roles, assignments, goals, etc. we're extremely ambiguous. On top of that, our supervisor always gave off a vibe that she was super busy, I.e. not very approachable. This was an eight week internship, and long story short I basically did nothing for that time. I did a few things here and there, but definitely not a lot. 

The thing is, I could have gotten a lot more out of the experience if it wasn't for my anxiety. The dynamics in the office were just not conducive to learning and clear communication (which I need.) we were basically told to figure out what we want to do and how to do it.

The supervisor gave me a lot of anxiety. I'm a scrawny awkward white dude, and she was a ~55F strong independent black woman (just to set the scene). I felt like any communication I had with her was unproductive, and usually resulted in me
looking dumb, or leaving with no helpful information. That being said, I avoided talking to her as much as I could.

Anyway, the internship is over now but many days were a personal hell for me. I just felt like I had nothing to do, and if I did I didn't have what I needed, AND I was expected to do stuff at the same time. I just wanted to get this off my chest. It's over but I still ruminate about it. ",Anxiety
"Can anyone relate to these ways of thinking? Does anyone think the same way? Does anyone else think this way or relate to these ways of thinking?

You think of the worst possible outcomes of a situation just to do anything to avoid that outcome from happening? 

You think about conversations over and over and over again in your head before they even happen? You play through the future conversations in your head to make sure you don't say anything stupid or sound dumb. 

Also, you think about past conversations and think ""oh I should've said this"" or ""oh I shouldn't or said that, I must've sounded so stupid"". When In reality these are conversations the other person most likely hasn't thought twice about and they probably even forgot about it by now. (Recent conversations and even ones from years ago)

You find yourself saying things like ""oh and let me know if I'm annoying you"" or ""let me know if you have something to do or if I'm bother you"". You put yourself down because you think that everyone thinks you are annoying even when to them you aren't and, they may really enjoy your company. You are just so conscious about being annoying and bothering them if they have things to do. 

When talking to adults you find yourself thinking as if they are always looking down on you. You think of your own problems as just stupid kid problems that they will think are dumb, when really, some are serious (like anxiety). You find yourself saying ""oh I know it's probably just a stupid teenager problem"" or ""I know I'm just a kid and you probably think it's stupid..."".

You find yourself just sitting or lying down and you stare at a single spot. All of the sudden it's like everything just flashes through your head at once. All of the things you've been worrying about recently and even some older things. They just all flash back at once and you just sit there trying to keep yourself from ""breaking"". You'll just try anything to keep yourself from crying and you may start shaking. (This is a new thing that's been happening, it's happened once or twice this week)

Whenever someone snaps at you or yells at you during the day, it won't go away. It's like that one part of your day is all you think about. You can't get it out of your head, even though it's already out of theirs. 

Say you are looking at your phone trying to show someone something but the internet won't load so you are just standing there. You'll start shaking and it just feels like it's taking forever.

You hate people sitting behind you. You just hate to sit there and know there are people looking at the back of you, watching every move you make, even if they aren't. You just hate that they are being behind you. Also, lets say you are in class and the teacher is walking while giving a lecture and they walk and stand by your desk while talking. You hate it because now everyone is basically staring at you while they're talking and you have to awkwardly look up at them while everyone is staring.

This list could go on and on but I think these are some of the main ways I think a lot and things that really bother me. ",Anxiety
"A Major worry that is taking over my life Okay, this might sound stupid. But please, bear with me.

Only starting a few days ago, after watching a comedy, the topic arose of how in billions of years the world would end.

I took a second, and thought about it. It's a really scary concept, which is almost inevitable.

Since then, every minute of everyday consists of me being worried about the world ending. By this I don't mean in our life time, but in billions of years. Even though I obviously won't be here to witness it, it REALLY scares and worries me. I now simply cannot take my mind off of it.

Now, to add insult to injury, having just had the New Year, the principal of large years just doesn't sound right and again, frightens and worries the hell out of me. I mean, 2057, 2141, do they sound like years to you?

I don't really know what to do about this. I could just be that I have been sitting down doing nothing for a while over New Years, but I am worried that it will really take over my life.

I am scared of death and the future in equal measures.

Sitting down, writing this, or doing nothing at all, I can feel my heart beating certainly faster than it should.

Can anyone advise? I really do not want to think about this for the rest of my life.

Thank you very much in advance.",Anxiety

"I think I may have an anxiety disorder. All my life I have been worrisome. Usually, when my anxiety would flare up due to school, or other unforeseen events, it would manifest itself in the form of a cold sore on my lip. As recently as December 2017, I started getting anxious as my first year of college was coming up. I expected to get a cold sore so i prepared by buying the proper medication. But this time no cold sore, just intense nausea and feeling nervous 24/7. This got so bad that I was rushed to the hospital. Initially my parents and I thought maybe this is an internal problem, maybe something wrong with my stomach. But $19,000 worth of tests later, the doctors say I'm fine. Only one doctor suggests this could all be caused by anxiety. I still feel as if being in school is not the cause of my anxiety- i really don't know what it is. But all i know is that i frequently get in these ""episodes"" where i get extreme nausea, excessive burping (not gas related), dizziness, and intense feeling of being nervous (I've described it as feeling nervous like I'm about to jump out of a plane and go parachuting, I've never been skydiving but i think it would feel this intense). These episodes happen at random and during times of distress, like right before a huge final I'm about to take for class. These symptoms make life very uncomfortable for me, I wish i had my normal life back. Can anyone else relate to me?

I think my therapist thinks I have some anti social personality disorder (I don't?) I see a therapist for social anxiety and it's only been a month or so but he gives me a weird vibe like he actually thinks I'm a sociopath. I told him that I have trouble connecting with people and he seems to believe that it's due to lack of effort/lack of craving for human connection. I know I'm socially awkward but that really doesn't mean that I don't want to be around people and I'm pretty sure I'm not a psychopath or sociopath. He talks to me like I actually don't have any understanding of human connection and he's brought up anti social disorders before but never definitively said he was talking about me. Today I asked him if he was doing anything fun during his break and he said it was good that I asked because it shows an effort for human connection and he wanted to know if I'm like that with other people (??it made me feel really weird). I don't know if I'm over-analyzing this but it does kinda create a trust issue and I feel like he's not saying everything he's thinking. Am I over thinking this? I'm definitely not gonna bring it up with him because it would be really weird if I'm totally wrong but I just don't know..,Anxiety

"Post-exam stress Hey people,

I just thought I would post something here. I am a student at university. Just started a year ago and I always used to have crazy good grades. The thing is, in the passed year, I really didn't get results as high as I would want and so when I would come out of an exam, I would stress like crazy non stop trying to count of many points I would get, if then I would pass, etc. Those thoughts can go really far most of the time. It just ruins my days until I actually get my result. I try to tell myself to only worry about the result when I'll actually get it and stop thinking about it all since I can't change anything of the exam, but it just doesn't work... I can't carry on like that all my uni years and I just don't know what to do.",Anxiety

"A four year struggle. I need your perspective. This is going to run a little long, so please bare with me. I'm turning to you Redditors for some help / perspective over some struggles I've had over the last 4 years. Some quick context, I'm a male (28) who grew up in a bit of a broken family and have family members (mom / brother) who have struggled with depression and anxiety their whole lives. 

I never thought that I had those struggles until I turned 24 and was in a job I absolutely hated, not making enough to make ends meet, and getting married to my wife (who is my rock, but it was very stressful because she just lost her job). This all snowballed into me going through 2 years of some serious up and down health issues. Mainly, intense stomach pains (plus, going to the bathroom 6-8 times a day), hot flashes, headaches, depression, body shaking/tremor, and overall fatigue. After seeing the doctor repeatedly (colonoscopies, CT scans, X rays, blood tests, etc.) we ruled out a lot of the bad stuff and was told that my anxiety was so bad that it shot my nerves and my gut was all screwed up. 

They eventually prescribed me 30mg of amitriptyline to take each night, which made a huge impact on my stomach. It still has a dull hurt to it, but no more bathroom issues and a good chunk of my depression/fatigue went away. I also quit the job I hate and got one that I've been at for two years and absolutely love. I've also been seeing a mental health professional and really working through some coping mechanics to help when I'm in bad shape. Over the past two years, I've also committed to eating better (not perfect though), drinking less (only on weekends and never in excess), exercising 2-4 times a week (I'm 5'11, 185 with decent muscle) and am very happy in my relationship / career. My mind still jumps to conclusions that I'm dying from some crazy ailment, but I'm much more prepared to deal with it then I ever was before. 

So why am I posting on Reddit? I need some perspective about the future from folks who have suffered from anxiety disorders for many, many years. 

Because the truth is – even with all the great progress I've made, I still never feel 100%. It's like I'm constantly a 5/10 – no matter what I do. I still have a body tremor/shakes that can get really, really noticeable when I'm stressed – even when I'm in situations I shouldn't be stressed in. For example, I had a meeting with a manager at work that I actually really like and get a long with, but what should have been maybe a little stress about her asking my opinions about a project snowballed into me having hot flashes, increased heart rate and noticeable shaking. The shaking never goes away, it just gets better or worse depending upon the situation or the amount of physical activity involved. Even going to the store today to pick up a prescription had me feeling crummy. These are almost always accompanied by hot flashes. You can tell because I will physically look flushed and my heart beat always picks up and starts racing. The times I feel best is when I'm at home, hanging out on the couch and doing something to take my mind off of it – like playing video games or reading. In the past, smoking or drinking would dull it too, although I know that was only a bandaid. 

Have any of you experienced something similar? What's your journey been like? How did you cope? Did you ever truly get better? 

I plan on visiting my doctor and discussing changing my prescription to Zoloft or something stronger that's really focused on anxiety – specifically hot flashes and tremors, but I'd love Reddits perspective first. I know I can't be alone in this. ",Anxiety

"So anxious about next week... need help! My boyfriend and I have been together for 1.5 years and we are in an extremely serious relationship. We both have to go out of town this coming week, him for two days and me for three. I was alright at first, because I had originally thought that we had a day or two in between our separate trips to spend time together. It would have been a little rough, but I could have probably handled it fine. However, I found out today that our trips will be overlapping. So I will be leaving when he's coming home. It will be 5 straight days of us not seeing each other. I have never been away from him that long in the entire time that I've known him, not even when we hit a small rough patch and ""took a break"" for a few weeks. We were still friends and had no more than two days in which we didn't see each other. 

I am really scared and anxious. I have pretty bad separation anxiety from him because before our little break, I hadn't seen him for a day or two and then things happened. Plus I have general anxiety so it's not a good mix.

Do you guys have any tips that can help me get through this? Thanks in advance!

"Treatment advice for the recently diagnosed NOTE: I am by no means a doctor, psychiatrist, psychologist, nor an expert of any kind. This is just based off of my personal experience with GAD and my treatment. I understand that Anxiety is not the same for everyone, it may be temporary or something people deal with for the rest of their life. Not all treatments work the same for everyone. I recommend seeing a medical professional before hand!



A few weeks ago, I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). However, I have been dealing with it for about 6 months with about 1-2 major panic attacks lasting about half an hour or more each per day. It was crippling me mentally and emotionally while draining any bit of stamina I had that day. Having the feeling that I was about to drop dead of a heart attack while my mind was being flooded negative thoughts and worry all the time really fucked me up. I finally mustered up the courage to see my doctor and get an official diagnosis. At that point I was willing to try anything to stop these frequent panic attacks. But at the same time, I didnt want to go on hardcore prescription meds anti-anxiety or anti-depressants. So I asked my doctor if there are any natural supplements that have been proven to work. She handed me a piece of paper that listed some natural supplements that help with Anxiety and ADHD (Because I have both). She recommended I take 1200mg of Omega-3 Fish Oil Capsles once every morning, about 4000mg of Inositol daily (2000mg twice per day), and 200mg of L-Theanine as needed if I ever start to feel anxious. 

As of right now, I have been taking these supplements consistantly and I am more than happy to say it has been working phenomenally! In the past few weeks I have only had 1 or 2 minor attacks that passed by me in about 5 minutes. 

The cool thing about these is these are natural supplements that you can buy without a prescription. The Inositol is a chemical found within the body. 

So, my point is, I would personally highly recommend after being officially diagnosed is to try natural supplements like these first before you try the prescription meds. Its always better to have a natural cure if possible.

"Crohn's, anxiety and hypochondria. I am going absolutely insane.

"Looking for just some encouragement and reassurance Hey :) 

So about two weeks ago I got an awesome job - I was to work as a barista in a location not far from my home, full-time. I was stoked. I've been working for these two weeks, and everyday I go home pumped that I did so well. I know about a year ago, I NEVER would have been able to handle a job with so much human interaction (thanks Lexapro). I made drinks, constantly washed tables, tried my best to say hi to coworkers... and then one day I messed up. In the morning, I woke up and was already late to work. I panicked and got a text from my supervisor asking where I was. I told her I was so sorry and that would be there soon. I immediately deleted my text history with her afterwards because I suddenly felt really guilty. I sat on my floor and cried a ton, and actually ended up passing out somehow on the floor. When I woke up, of course, I was even later. I was freaking out and even considered calling my mom... who I haven't gone to for reassurance since I moved out. I had no idea what to do. I did not think I was fit to work. I also did not think having a mental breakdown was good enough as an excuse to take a sick day, especially so late. Yet I still mustered the courage to call the office, and though I hesitated a ton and sounded awful, I told the woman that I was not feeling well and wasn't sure if I could come in.

She told me that my position was very important and that they needed me. I had only just started - did I really want to take a sick leave so soon? I didn't know this at the time, but she is in charge of hiring and firing staff. I had called the highest higher-up and told her I couldn't come in, all for a stupid panic attack. It might have been dumb, but I took an extra Lexapro to feel less and began getting ready for work. Almost 2 hours late. The Lexapro did begin to work thankfully, though I felt super tired and weird. I also couldn't feel as much pain or paranoia from being looked at by my coworkers however.

That day, I worked as normal and it honestly seemed fine. Nobody mentioned it, and my supervisor was still relatively kind. Things were really looking up, and I remembered how much I really loved just makin drinks for people.

Then today. My supervisor tells me that the woman I called had talked to her. My supervisor says that she asked the woman to give me one more week to prove... something. Am I going to get fired? Should I even try? I love working here, and I thought I was doing so well. I was so happy for the few weeks I've been here. I don't want to leave. I feel like every time I get hired for a cafe I get dropped within a month, usually without a warning or even a goodbye. Yet this is only my second job... it feels irrational to worry about that. But I feel so useless and stupid. I asked my supervisor what I could do better for this week, and she said that I needed to take more initiative maybe when talking with customers. This stung a bit since I had honestly made some good connections with a few and it feels like I've been doing a poor job when I was so proud of what I had accomplished :( other than that, she says I am doing alright. This didn't really make me feel better... I feel like there's no point. I'm as a good as gone. It's gotten to the point where I wonder if I should move all the way back home because clearly I'm not good enough to do this. I thought I had recovered but I guess I'm still not good enough to do anything an average person could do better. They have no reason to keep me. I just want to stay so, so bad. I love making drinks... I would do it for free if I could :( 

I'm just looking for any sort of reassurance I guess. It feels desperate and sad to be reaching for this on reddit, but I don't want to let my parents know. They know how much fun I've been having at this job, and it would crush them to see that my anxiety got the better of me in the end. I can't really handle any criticism right now. I feel like I'm going to break. I'm tempted even just to pack up a bag and just leave. Yet I know it won't let me leave the guilt of the situation. Please help. I feel like I've fucked up and that all my beliefs of recovery were fake. I haven't recovered at all, I'm just pretending. I can't hold a job. I don't want to be here. If anybody has anything to say to help, please please tell me. I'm honestly really desperate for it.",Anxiety
"In constant fear of a heart attack? 38 year old male with history of anxiety and stress. I'm not overweight or smoke or even have a history of heart issues but I have been in this state of constant fear and over analyzing my heart rate for a few weeks now. It all started with heart palpitations that pop up here and there and has gone to being in a state of bracing for something bad to happen. Right now I am so anxious I am shaking a bit and feel like if I move too much I will die. I know I need to see a therapist and working to find one. I am on Prozac but not sure it's working.

"Health anxiety So I have suffered from anxiety for a couple of years now. It comes and goes but it doesn't seem to be related to anything that happens in my life. I had a big dispute with friends and I had exams after that and I didn't have any symptoms. But in december and this beginning of january it' been horrible.

I start to get anxious from how I feel and it snowballs. This week I had a lightly bloody nose each morning (probably due to the cold) it made it awful to do anything. If I was left with nothing to do I automatically monitor my health and pick up on anything. And the stress causes more symptoms

Does anybody else have these kind of health anxiety issues? I'm 22 and skinny or just right on the bmi chart, no past illnesses or fractures or anything but I still feel myself worry from the symptoms anxiety gives me

"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger? I was driving into work today calmly thinking about the day ahead. A car ahead of me takes the exit lane off the freeway and slows down. Just as the exit lane ends the other driver decides that they took the wrong exit and jumps back into my lane directly in front of me.

In a split second, I decide that there is no way I'll be able to decelerate fast enough to avoid plowing into them. They are going slow and I am going over 60mph. I swerve into the next lane barely avoiding clipping their car. My car proceeds to fishtail from the sharp maneuver to the point that I feel it might spin out. Miraculously, I am able to stabilize it. No harm done, right?

How I felt during was surreal. Time slowed down and it was eerily quiet. As I thought my car would spin out I distinctly remember thinking, ""Oh well, this must be how it ends."" It was not panic but a calm casual observation.

Once I stabilize the car I feel rage. I match speed with the other car and blare my horn at them. Still not really sure if they even realized their error. The adrenaline hits; I feel my whole body go hot and numb while I attempt to process it all.

It could've ended really badly. Had I not been paying attention I might have plowed into the car at full speed. Had there been a car in the lane I swerved into it could have been even worse. Had I not been driving a car with a stiff suspension that's low to the ground on dry pavement it would have surely spun out.

Then my mind goes into overdrive: Did I evaluate the situation correctly or did I overreact? Should I have jammed on the brakes and stayed in the lane? Was swerving pure stupidity on my part? Did I trade a potentially survivable collision for a potentially lethal one? Do I make bad split second decisions? What will happen next time? Why was I so calm when I thought it was the end? If everything can be wiped out in a split second then what's the point?",Anxiety

"Is this anxiety? Or a major underlying condition? When I become anxious over something and I can't calm myself down, I have stomache pains. These pains will continue until I throw up, and even after, shivering and dry mouth. All of this previewed by excessive bowel movements before the stomache pain. This cycle happens like clockwork, late at night, when i am subconsciously anxious. Almost every time it occurs, I will usually stay up all night because of the pain and stomache issues. As I type this, I'm going through another cycle.

It is prompted by what I believe my dog is starting to show signs of dying. I cannot really handle this fact, will most likely have to put him down tomorrow.

"I feel like I relapsed with impulse control. Like I'm an alcoholic and just got served alcohol. I have poor, poor, impulse control. I started taking Trileptal for bipolar. Well, I was doing some heavy research on it, and came across the fact that it can cause hormonal birth control to be less effective. I have Implanon. I am also breastfeeding, and that is why the doctor picked this medicine. I was told from a previous pdoc that he could only give me Seroquel. So I was happy when this pdoc found that Trileptal was safe, but he advised that I stop breastfeeding. This isn't possible at the moment because my 1 year old won't eat enough to sustain her. We're working on it, but it's going to take time. 

 

Well, once I found this out I told my SO and I started thinking maybe we should have another baby. He basically said no. Maybe we can revisit it in the future. However, I want one now. I don't want to wait, and I feel like it's never going to happen. I feel like I've relapsed because I was OK with not having a baby. I talked with my og/gyn and she promised to put in my birth control right after she takes out the old one so I won't go home and get pregnant before I can come back. So my options were taken away and I dealt with it. Well now, there is a chance. I feel like I was put in a bad position, because now I have to make the choice to not have another kid and I struggle with it. It doesn't feel fair that somehow this was missed and now I have to deal with this situation. 

 

Also, I have to either change my pills(which I like so far), or get on a different birth control. The only one I know of is the copper IUD which I heard bad things about. I had Mirena and hated it. I don't want to change my birth control, I love it. I don't know if there are any other safe meds for me to take anyway. It feels like I've been put in an awful situation. And every time I take my pill I think of how I can't have a baby. I'm currently in therapy, and plan on talking about this with my therapist but I don't see her for another week. This is hard. My mind is telling me I want a baby now, and if I can't have one then I never want one. It's so stupid and I know it's stupid. But it hurts and right now that is all I can see. That I can't have a baby. 

TLDR; Got on medication that make birth control less effective and now I have to have some impulse control. ",BPD
"How can I tell the difference between legitimate relationship problems and BPD issues? So, my boyfriend and I have been together since April, 2011.  Then we were a great fit and we seemed to bring out the best in each other.  Then, a couple of years ago, we moved back to my home town and lots of things have gone really great for me.  I had previously had a life that was kinda a wreck with job instability, relationship instability and little to no income, but I've started to change most of that.  I've held my current job for over a year (which is a big achievement for me) and I make plenty of money there, too.    


But, then, there's my boyfriend.  


I know instability is part of BPD.  And I was diagnosed with BPD before the two of us ever got together.  I've sensed somem relationship problems with us for a while and I'm starting to wonder.... are these problems legitimate or is it just BPD wanting to make a stable relationship and make it unstable?  More specifically, these are the issues we're having:  


1)  Job.  This is the big one.  He's been working temp jobs for a while.  He currently doesn't have a job because his last temp job ended less than a week ago.  But even when he has a temp job and he knows it's going to end, he doesn't put too much effort into finding a new, permenant job.  Some of that is understandable because the 9-5 hours he works makes it difficult to go to interviews, but he's not even trying.  And it's frustrating for me.  


2)  Planning ahead in general.  This goes right along with the job.  He's not thinking about when the job ends so he has no plans when it does end..  He wasn't planning on getting a job that paid less so now he's struggling to keep up with his car payment.  He wasn't worried about the tag on his car and the late fees resulted in him having to pay $1000 to update the tag.  Stuff like that.  He's not thinking ahead or he procrastinates horribly and things crash around him because of it.  


3)  Sex.  I don't want to get too into details here; I can say I can understand some of the issues he has with sex, but I honestly can't remember the last time we've done anything.  And I've lost a lot of weight and I've gotten myself looking a lot better, but if I ever want to get close to him, to cuddle, to kiss, he just kinda shrugs me off.  It's frustrating for me because I want to be close to someone and if he won't do it...... what are my options?  Cheat?  Do I really want to do that?  


4)  Responsibilities in general.  He's worried about some grass roots activism stuff, which I can't criticize itself, but he's often so focused on it that he doesn't take care of the rest of his responsibilities.  I feel like I've gotten a lot more responsible and together over the past year or so (a good stable job will do that) but he hasn't.  He's not even trying I don't feel like.  And..... I dunno.  A big part of me worries that if I tie myself to him, will he drag me down or am I able to pull him up?  


So, those seem to be the cores of our relationship problems from my perspective.  But it's an 8 year relationship; it's hard to give that up.  Especially since he has the car, not me (I'm lucky to be able to walk to and from work).  I'm forcing myself to question, would stability be better for my life or would it be better for me to drop a relationship with someone who isn't doing their fair share?  Does anyone have any input or suggestions or can you relate with any of this?",BPD

"Ex with BPD says she was raped by her ex-boyfriend I had been dating this girl for a little while who has a kid with her ex-boyfriend. They were together for several years. She told me there were issues with him still, that he was very hard to get a long with, and that he was still wanting to be with her despite her constant rebuttals.  She told me that he was very manipulative, and that seemed pretty clear pretty early. He had too much control over important things in her life, not to mention he was able to keep her from seeing her kid pretty much altogether when they lived in a different state. She says that this last part is a huge fear of hers and makes it easy for him to manipulate her, that he'll just find a way to take her kid away from her again. 

 I started to notice that she was still in contact with him and would talk to him about things other than their kid, and I told her this made me feel uncomfortable and suggested it would probably be best for everyone involved if she didn't do that. She agreed, and said she cut contact with him. Not long after, I realized that she hadn't. She was still talking to him, and not just about their kid. She said that she was afraid to because if she didn't pander to him, he might do something drastic to fuck her life over. This pattern continues, of her saying she has cut off contact with him, I find out she is hiding the fact that she hasn't, and she says she can't help herself because she's afraid of him.  On top of all of this, he has claimed that they have been sleeping together for the duration of our relationship.  He has proven himself to me, not based on her side of things, to be a liar and a manipulator, and so I don't exactly take what he says as truth and figure he might just be trying to fuck up our relationship.

So after another bout of her not being honest with me about talking to him, as well as allowing him drive her to the laundry mat because she ""felt like she didn't have any other options"", I basically tell her that I'm just going to ask him what's going on and believe what he tells me, and that it would be much better for her to come clean.  This leads her to telling me that within the course of our relationship he forced her to have sex with him twice. Both of these times required her to go to his house.  Her reasoning for going to his house was because she had recently moved out and she was afraid he was going to do something to some family heirlooms that had a great deal of emotional value to her.  Another time was because she was desperate to figure something out about her daughter and he wouldn't talk to her on the phone.  She also says that he would pressure her for sex that she felt was non-consensual throughout the relationship, using a combination of intimidation and guilt.

At this point, I don't know what to believe. She has hid so much from me, all of it revolving around her interactions with him (even small things where I'm certain nothing salacious happened, like signing custody paperwork while her roommate was there) and all of it because she said she was afraid if I found out she was still interacting with him that I would break up with her.  I hate to think that she is lying about what I would call rape just so that she doesn't look like she did anything wrong, but with all of the deceit I have to wonder.

I don't know if this is the best place to post this, but she has been diagnosed with BPD for some time and seems to check many of the boxes, including a fear of abandonment, allowing her decisions to be almost exclusively driven by her feelings and therefore often irrational (if she is to believed about the non-consensual sex, even being alone with someone who has proven to be dangerous), splitting, and several more.

Any advice on what I should think about all of this or if it sounds typical in any way would be greatly appreciated, thank you.",BPD
"I feel like it's never going to get better This might be long and hard to understand but I need to talk to people who will hopefully understand. 

I am undiagnosed but I relate to several if not all symptoms of BPD.  (Not asking to be diagnosed, just explaining my situation)

I'm 17, I've just graduated. I've been through therapist after therapist and psychiatrist after psychiatrist over the years and I've had little to no luck. I don't work well with therapists. I always have the urge to lie about small things and over time it creates discrepancies between what actually happened and what the therapist thinks happened and I get too anxious to correct them. I also forget so many important details. They ask for a timeline and I can't give it to them because I don't keep track of how many months ago I had that specific mental breakdown or when I started cutting or when I decided I hated myself.

I'm fairly certain my boyfriend is sick of my shit. I have essentially no one to talk to but him and he believes he can no longer help me. I consistently vent to him even though it makes him feel guilty and he has no solutions for me. I can't spend a day apart from him without losing my mind. It's unhealthy. He's my only source of comfort anymore. He's said he's dealt with crazy before but I doubt it was ever like this. I feel so alone. I used to have a best friend but she doesn't talk to me much anymore. 

I used to have hobbies and healthy coping mechanisms. I used to draw, edit videos, play video games, watch movies, read, write, watch youtube videos  and now I do nothing. I have no hobbies. Drawing frustrates me, everything bores me and I  have absolutely no motivation to create anything. I used to listen to music and draw to cope. Music does nothing for me anymore. It doesn't calm me down anymore, it doesn't feel familiar, it feels like I'm not even hearing it. 

I can't remember the last time I was legitimately happy anymore. My moods range from meh to suicidal. I used to at least feel euphoria when I was manic. I don't even get to enjoy that anymore.  

I'm prescribed 10 mg of Lexapro. It does nothing for my moods aside from slight stabilization. It feeds into my disordered eating by not allowing me to enjoy food. So I just don't eat. The most comforting thought I have right now is fantasizing about starving to death. I'm already pushing people away so eventually they'll give up and let me go. Worst case scenario, I get hospitalized again and maybe then I can get help.

I used to never cry but now I cry every single day. I have never felt so horrible.

I don't think I'll ever feel okay. My dad has a variety of mental illnesses and he's on a cocktail of medications that have turned him into a zombie. That's going to be me. 

I don't want to be like this. I'm hurting people and probably making their moods worse. I'm so tired of trying to get better. I've tried so hard to make myself happy and it feels like my brain is constantly tearing itself apart while I frantically try to pick up the pieces but by the time I get everything back together, it's too late.

"The Magic of Music So there I was last night. 'Twas that magical day of the year that we all hate and wish to avoid....the dreaded birthday! The plan was for me to grill burgers when I got home. So I get to it...

I was making burgers with some good high-quality 93/7 beef, and using cauliflower for a filler. They actually turned out really good, and even the kids complimented them. 

So there I am, get the grill fired up and the wife and kids hop in the pool. (Now, I know what ya'll are thinking....what the fuck are you doing in the house making dinner on your birthday? Like I said, I'm a giver.) I slip out to the garage for a much needed puff, after which In head back inside. 

Eventually, I realized it was just too damn quiet in the house, so I fired up some tunes via Pandora. 

As I am standing there in the kitchen, completely immersed in my task at hand, Motley Crue came on and that's when I caught myself doing it; I smiled! Then I followed it up with a thought about how good life is...

I immediately realized what In had done and tool advantage of the moment to try to figure out where that came from. It didn't take me long to figure this one out. There were three elements at play here.

1. I was completely immersed in something that I enjoy; cooking. 

2. I had just smoked a bit of cannabis and was feeling the effects starting to take hold.

3. I was listening to music. 

That's it, it's music!! I used to always listen to music, everywhere I went. When I'm at work I pop my headphones in and can whip out code for 10 hours straight without getting up from my seat. Lately, I haven't been listening to music at work and my motivation has been suffering. 

Music helps me. I have to remember that. Even if I don't want to listen to music (because when I'm in the pit of emotionless chaos, the last thing that I want to do is have to decide what to listen to...) I need to remember to pull it on. It will help me...

Anybody else feel this way? Anybody feel like music lifts them up and can *almost* make us feel human again? ",BPD
"Is isolation the answer? This is my first time posting on here, so I'm a bit nervous, but after creeping around for a while this seems like a very supportive community, so I'm hoping for some help, or at least a listening ear. About two years ago I developed a very close circle of friends. We hung out all the time, and things seemed to be going great. One friend in particular became the best friend I've ever had in my entire life (after learning more about BPD I've realized he was my first FP). A few months in is when the BPD symptoms started to occur. We all know what those are so I won't get into the details, but it wasn't pretty. Fast forward about a year and half to last May, and after constantly feeling hurt and unloved and not wanted to these so-called best friends of mine, I decided to ditch them all. Every since then things have been kind of off and on with everyone, except my FP refuses to talk to me. With my FP pretty much abandoning me and my worst fear coming true, I'm having a hard time trusting ANYONE. I don't put in effort with other relationships due to a mixture of not caring and wanting to build a wall around myself to keep anyone else from hurting. I don't really have any friends anymore because the few friends and acquaintances I did have fizzled due to me not initiating and clearly them not caring enough to do it either. Since being on my own for almost a year, I've found that my BPD systems seem to have calmed way down (no one to trigger me ya feel), but at the same time I don't experience the highs either. Instead of being up and down, I'm just kind of stuck in neutral and feeling kind of numb. But is that better than being is full swing BPD mode literally 24/7 like I was a year ago?

"Venting over sadness, asking for coping mechanisms This is probably one of the most ridiculous reasons to get triggered into a depression episode, but I was with a friend and her boyfriend at a bar, and he said he'd go for a smoke and kissed her and said ""I love you"" and I just go incredibly sad because my bf never says it. I ended up ditching the bar and going to cry in a hot dog stand (which feels as incredibly pathetic as it sounds)

My relationships was never too great to start with but at least the first year he would constantly tell me he loved me and then the past year he stopped completely. He refuses to reassure me or be supportive when I'm having crisis. Not too long ago we had a fight and he just went into ignoring me because he didn't want to be having to deal with me or reassure me that he wanted to be with me. So he left me talking(texting) by myself for almost an hour in which I grew increasingly distressed. I ended having self harm episode most of the night and stayed up crying. And the next day he acted like nothing without even asking how I was or anything. 

I know I should probably just break up because is very obvious he doesnt love me nor care about me, or he wouldn't have left me talking alone. But I find it very hard to do, and I don't like the idea of never talking again. 

I'm obviously not ready to break up, but what can i do to cope with the sadness. I don't want to be feeling so miserable whenever I hear  or see someone expressing love. Would really like to avoid going to cry to another hot dog stand(or any other types of stands)

Has anyone find anything that works for dealing with feelings intensity? I always try the distraction thing and doing other activities but lately i don't find the energy to push myself into doing something else, and mostly spend most of the time out of work in bed. I try watching series but there's always romantic scenes in most of them that just make me feel sort of sad...

Any series or film anyone can recommend? Or any other coping mechanisms that work? Going out or doing an activity that requires a lot of body effort is not an option because of how hard i'm finding it to even get out of bed.

Any recommendation will be appreciated, and hope you are all having a decent/good day.",BPD
"Does anyone find mood tracking pointless? To start off, for me, it wasn't TOTALLY pointless before because I used an app to track my moods when I was diagnosed only with bipolar, and then I was able to discern that I do in fact have BPD as well due to the many fluctuations and the reasons behind those fluctuations.

HOWEVER, after I realized I was BPD and bipolar, I stopped giving a fuck at all. My logic was that it's too exhausting to properly track my mood as I have so many fluctuations that 20 entries a day of ups and downs is utterly impossible to track accurately. I notice on these apps I can barely provide a good explanation too, like as in, what I was feeling that moment or what caused my split.

I've come to the conclusion that I'm just one of those people who cannot journal or keep track of their moods for their life. Does anyone else feel this way? I'm not trying to bag on anyone who actually does track their moods at all. In fact, if you do track your moods, good for you, I wish I could have the persistence and consistency to follow through with it. It's just I can't make the effort to do it, nor do I feel that it will help with my progress at all since I just cycle so so so much.",BPD

Now...I could be reading into it, but it just feels like people genuinely don't care if you are crying in public. Or if you share with them your physical and emotional scars. It's not going to change their day to day. They are not going to suddenly reach out to you more, or watch what they say in fear of hurting you. 

They don't care about your progress, just that you handle your shit on your own. ",BPD
"I need advice. I don't feel comfortable posting anywhere else because I'm afraid no one will understand. Hi, 17 year old kid here

Throughout my life, I've moved a lot. I don't recall being in one place ever for more than 2 or 3 years. I honestly can't remember a good portion of my childhood because it's all very blurry to me.

Basically, I don't feel comfortable with any family member. They seem like strangers to me. They speak a different language which I have difficulty conveying myself in, have a different culture, and seem completely different.

My dad has anger issues and frequently has black/white thinking in which he devalues me yet returns to completely acting normal (pretty sure he is BPD too but he doesn't believe in mental illness). I remember one time when he got violent and told me I was the reason that he wanted to kill himself, because I was such a failure (I was a 16 year old in HS).

My mom's a little better I guess but she also doesn't believe in the nonsense in my head. 

Honestly? I feel like I'm imprisoned. I don't like being around family because everything seems so weird/foreign to me that I begin to depersonalize/derealize like crazy and just disappear for an hour. It makes me uncomfortable and it makes me feel lonely.

I feel like I had no childhood and I feel like I have no one I can trust. My younger brother (who doesn't have BPD) thinks I'm crazy and also doesn't believe in mental illness, he just thinks I have a ""mental deficiency"" of some kind. He frequently tells me that he thinks I'm useless and I don't amount to anything. I feel like I don't have a family. 

I'm frequently tell them that I'd just rather spend time alone. They interpret this as a sign of disrespect and get angry at me. They're so different, it feels like they're strangers, I cannot stress this enough.

I leave for university in January and I can't wait. Can someone please answer, am I just being an ungrateful child? I've honestly have never felt so lonely and I feel like I don't have anyone I can trust.",BPD
"ugh why must I be so insanely attracted to people who are nice to me? I went out last night and ran into an old friend from high school. We never were really close, but I had dated his friend so we were in the same circle.  We talked quite a bit last night and we were still friends on FB so he sent me a message after he got home saying we should hang out again some time and we've been casually talking ever since. I can't get him out of my damn head now, he has a girlfriend and I have a boyfriend so UGHH, spent all day with boyfriend today and I still can't get this other person out of my head, all because he showed me basic human kindness.

But, I was asleep on him and he was on his phone and I woke up. I saw Tinder and Snapchat and all I want to do is take the bus to the nearest cliff and jump off it...it's quarter past 2 am and I can't sleep at all and I feel like I'm going nuts.

"damaged life, But I want to decrease the pain and open up ( Triggering ) I am really nervous and I just want to open up about the things that I faced and what made me the person that I am today, If this post broke the rules, please contact me and I will delete it. I had a rough childhood but I didn't notice it until less than a year ago, therapy helped me a lot regarding remembering my past, and I advise some people to do it if they can. My childhood has not been off my mind ever since and I am falling into a dark hole, but I wanted to share it with some people to feel better, here you go:

1- I was sexually harassed/Abused: By teachers, students, strangers, boys I used to like, I was forced to touch a 20-year-old when I was 14, he was doing everything I was just Frozen, I said no a couple of times, but I didn't want him to see me as a person that disappointed him so I acted like I'm interested.

2- I was bullied excessively: my uncle used to call me fat and ugly and make fun of me in front of the whole family, my aunt also did so. I was bullied by my cousins, I was called a whore, slut, cow, pig, fat, I was pushed by them, and when we were playing (It was in the dark), some of these boys touched me sexually and I couldn't do anything. My father now still calls me ugly and fat. even though I am average. I was bullied at school.

3- I had night terrors: No one used to help me with these nightmares, I used to calm myself as a child and just ""Dealt with it"".

4- I had no attention/love: I didn't have any not from my parents, -I was mostly ignored by my mom and dad- I didn't have friends, it was rocky, never stable. I was looking for attention and love as a child, from boys, even older people I just liked that I was valued.

5- Impulsivity: I ran away from school once, I just walked alone in the streets just because I wanted some ""Action"" in my life, I used to smoke cigs, but never did drugs. Although, I wanted to so bad. I wanted to burn myself, just for the ""thrill"" of it. 

6- Pathological lying: I used to lie a lot to my friends/cousins about me buying them gifts, me having a disease that will kill me, Just because I wanted people to feel sorry for me. I lied about me buying them gifts just because I wanted to see them happy and because someone loves me and won't leave me. 

I also did experience some stuff, but I thought that sharing it will maybe be just too personal. I am sorry if this may sound too personal/oversharing to some people, I just had to let it all out. I have no one to share this, without the fear of judgment. Have a good day.",BPD

"Instability I am feeling more unstable. An unfortunate miscalculation on my part has led to me being off one of the anti-depressants I take for roughly a week now and it's scary how quickly I have declined. My mood is fluctuating aggressively and I can't regulate my emotional responses to things. Show me a dog video? I will cry like a member of my family has just died. One minute I'm feeling amazing and half an hour later I wish I was dead. 

My GP recommended that I take 20mg of my tricyclic antidepressant instead of my normal 10mg for a week because of my depression worsening post deferring from university. At the end of the week I was still feeling awful and decided to just keep taking 20mg because fuck it, I feel better on 20mg and I no longer cared what I was putting into my body medication wise. A higher dose made things not hurt and so of course I'm going to keep taking it.

I started thinking that I don't need the medication at all. I messed up more of my medication by not refilling a prescription on time and now I have to play mad scientist and play around with what I do have remaining to meet the correct dosage for 2 days. I feel very jumbled up mentally and I don't know if I'm making sense or if any of this is coherent. 

I feel wretched. I have started having small visual hallucinations again and am going into a place where I am very clearly not well. I sleep excessively, my ability to take care of myself fluctuates (I like my beauty regime. I have off days where I don't do any of it). Something doesn't feel right but I can't stop myself. I am absolutely not in the real world right now. I don't know who I am, I don't know where I am or what my place is. ",BPD
"Everyone with BPD should read The Language of Emotions It's a book by Karla McLaren. We studied it in my DBT program, and it was, to say the least, more of a door slam than Brené Brown's work on shame and vulnerability. 

Being able to understand why I was angry changed a lot for me. It allowed me to set boundaries, because I could identify my values, and that helped me to figure out my identity. 

Im still learning and growing and healing. Im nowhere near finished. But this book was pretty revolutionary for me. 

Please read it :)",BPD
"Finally accepted that I am BPD. It's not easy to digest. About two months or so ago, with the help and encouragement of my family I started going to therapy after many, many years of mood swings, outbursts, self-harm and depression that I had pushed through somehow. 

A couple of weeks back, my therapist brought up the potential diagnosis and started talking me into DBT.  I didn't want to hear it. I was so angry that she'd want to just plaster a clinical name on my struggle, because as much as it is comforting to feel like there's a name to this madness and actual therapy specifically for it... I can't help but feel sick to my stomach reading about my own behaviors, how hard it is for people around me, how difficult it is to get better. I was angry at her for putting that burden on me. 

Everything I feel is so _loud_. 
Small things feel like the end of the world, good things feel like I'm high on something, the actual bad things give me suicidal thoughts.  I want to dial my feelings down, it feels like they're screaming into my ears and pulling my hair, consuming me, and I hurt myself to quiet them, or I push them out by lashing out at whoever is on my way.  

Anyone I get too close to has to deal with outbursts of anger, what I now understand to be idealization and devaluation, followed by victimization and guilt, followed by deep depressive episodes. I don't want to put anyone through that, so I shut them out instead, but it just makes everything worse it seems. So I try really hard to be be rational about these screaming voices and drown them, to be a better person, just to find that I can't contain them and let them explode. 

I've accrued all these instances where I've hurt people I love in this way, and I keep thinking of them and feeling so much guilt and shame.

I know and understand what it is now. After a wake-up call from my boyfriend, basically laying down how much it hurts him every time I have an outburst, I've decided to pull some courage in and accept it and work on it. I can't keep doing this, it hurts me and everyone. I want it to stop, but I'm also scared. I feel so stable today, but when will the next set of screams hit me? What if I mess everything again? 

I really want to try. I'm not sure why I'm posting here anyway. To write about it, or for hope, or maybe to let everyone else who goes through this that they're not alone. ",BPD
"The ever growing appeal of Sadism Hello fam jam, I got some stuff I wanna talk through and whether or not any of you have experienced similar things. I've notice over the last year I've had an increasing appeal to domination and sadism. These things kinda alarm me because that kinda stuff has never appealed to me before. I think part of the domination thing is definitely the idea of being in control of a situation so people can't abandon me, and the sadistic thing is an outlet for the intense anger I feel towards people who've triggered me. Idk 

I was talking to someone else who has bpd about this and they said they actually swing towards sub-masochist because they felt secure with a dom and they felt relief from the pain that they were inflicted with. 

Any of y'all got anything to say about this kinda stuff? Similar experiences? Thoughts?",BPD
"My ex gf has BPD - Worrying about someone you lost Lurked for a while, first time posting. I recently broke up with my almost 6 year gf, and it ended up awfully. Even though I cannot, and will not, contact her, I still worry every day for her mental health. My friends are taking care of her to an extent, but I just know and feel her.

She is dating someone else, which is great and I'm very excited about. Nonetheless, she can get obsessed pretty quickly. And I know more about the guy than she ever will, with a history of abuse, even hitting a partner before, and borderline abusing sexually another partner (she had to make him stop forcefully). I know that she probably think the world is stable for the first time in weeks, craving love and attention, but we <all> know how tragic that's gonna end up.

Knowing stuff like that just worries me, not as an ex, but because I wanted her to get better, and I know that guy will destroy her. What's the best way to deal with a person with BPD (her, in this case), who will never have your direct support again? Should I talk to our friends, even though they will not do anything/think I'm trying to ruin her possibilities of happiness? My current s/o, who's been very supportive, knows about the story and is worried sick about it as well.

I stopped taking my hormonal birth control about two months ago and am having the worst flare up of my symptoms I've had in several years. What's funny is that I stopped taking said birth control (that I'd been taking for maybe 6-7 years consistently) because abruptly, I felt like maybe it was the cause of some emotional instability I was experiencing.

I am so desperate.  This wasn't just a boyfriend.  This is the one I know I should have treasured and will pay for it the rest of my life.  The love of my life, the one I know for a fact I will never be able to replace.  I will never be so attracted to someone - it took me 28 years to find him and it was intoxicating.  His eyes were so amazing, he was so different and amazing, we had an instant super strong connection just after looking at each other.  His smell, every single imperfection, I had no idea this kind of love existed.  And he felt the same.  Blah, here I go again, endless spiral of regret in this situation.  But again, he isn't like any of my other boyfriends.  

I am in so much horrible pain.  I know the ""horrible"" part of that is the BPD, it feels ten times stronger than it probably should.  But I won't start medication until next week, and this is endless, horrible pain, in the bottom of my stomach, from the moment I wake up until the moment I go to bed.  I am so desperate for the pain to go away I am taking random pills, drinking myself into a coma every night.  I just want it to go away.  

The worst part about this is that I am a single mom.  I am trying so desperately to not let this affect them, but it's impossible.   I don't have enough control over my brain.  I can't get it together no matter what I tell myself.  I am literally unable to eat, the food won't stay down.  I don't have a single person to talk to about this.  I am totally alone.

But every morning is the same. I wake up, feel like maybe this time will be different, get up, do things, feel good, fall back asleep,  wake up around 2PM, feel worthless, self harm, and prepare for another day of wishing I was dead and not getting to sleep till 6am.

I've tried going outside, exercising, eating, showering, punching myself in the fucking face, drinking coffee so hot I hope it'll burn me awake. Nothing works. That ""person"" I am when I first wake up will inevitably go back to sleep. And I can't get it to stop. I can't just feel like I have any control over my fucking life.

"Why Can't We Find Professional Help? My wife (28f) and I (28m) have had unbelievable difficulty in finding any lasting professional help for her BPD for the past 3 years and I fear we will divorce before we're ever able to do so. She has had trouble finding anyone willing to help her for essentially her entire adult life. A typical counseling life cycle lasts a few months at most before they tell her she is beyond their abilities to help. We do not have anyone in our area that specifically advertises a specialty or willingness to help people with BPD or other attachment disorders (she was also diagnosed with Reactive Attachment Disorder previously).

I'm confident our new marriage won't last another year if we don't get her some serious help. We're both considering out of state inpatient for her but that is going to ruin us financially and put strain in a number of other areas of our lives. I'm unbelievably desperate to find her help. I'm sick and tired of getting the runaround or being ignored entirely by so many local counselors that are unable to offer any sort of help and just cost us more time and money. 

Her symptoms are incredibly severe and our relationship is highly volatile. I live through weekly divorce threats, occasional physical attacks, regular emotional abuse, verbal attacks/scenes in public, suicide threats, suicide attempts, constant finger pointing... you name it. I'm cutting my lifespan short dealing with the episodes she puts me through on a daily basis. I do realize she's a victim and I want to get her help for both of our sake. We both recognize how important it is for her to find help but it seems impossible. Are BPD sufferers supposed to just suck it up and live like this? How were some of you able to find lasting and effective help?

Can anyone offer any advise on a good next move for us? We're tired of going in circles, we need to find someone willing to help her as soon as possible.",BPD

"Non-BPD trying to connect the dots My BPD ex got married to her partner. She was cheating on him the entire time while we were in love. However in few months, she decides to get married and over very minor issue she discarded me. It hurt me so much that I went down in deep depression. I tried connecting with her several times but she wouldn't talk and only push me away saying mean things to me.

 We work in the same office and I used to see her everyday. Slowly I started detaching myself, did some self therapy and went NC with the ex BPD. Once I went NC, I realized she was being playful and trying to get back my attention towards her. She'd make suggestive comments while passing me or sometimes would give me weird long stares just to get my attention. 

I was so hurt from her abandoned and absolute non-closure that I started to look for a new job. Once I got the job, I let her know. She was silent the entire time, although she came to the office the next day completely changed. She dyed her hair red and dressed up in a fashion that she never does or did. 

What could be the reason why she was doing push and pull? Why did she dye her hair and trying to change herself after knowing that I was leaving? Do you think I was ever important to her to hurt her at all?

"Blaming SO for insecurities. Please help. I have loved lurking this community. You all help each other so much. Throwaway because my friends and SO know my real one. Anyways...

Been with my SO for two and a half years. We met shortly after I started medication and ""completed"" a therapy program for bpd. I was in my healthiest state of mind and continued to be in a healthy state of mind until recently. 

This is honestly the most supportive, communicative and open relationship I've ever been in. 

Recently I've been really struggling with myself. I lost a ton of weight and I feel like it's too much. My curves left and I know how my SO enjoys curves and so do I. I've been sort of trying to gain weight and muscle up but not trying as hard as I should and I am mad at myself for it. 

What's happening now is all confirmation bias. I feel like I constantly see him looking at curvier girls. I have been panicking about him looking at porn. I freak out when we are in public around girls. I feel like I'm not good enough, not what he wants. To add to it, we recently moved in together which of course means things have calmed down. Not as romantic, not as sexual, more comfortable. I know all of that is natural but in my head it confirms that he isn't as into me. 

No matter what he says I'm miserable. But I know this is my issue and I need to fix it. I started lashing out at him when we are around attractive females. 

Sorry this is so long but any advice would be wonderful.

"Don't like my 'therapist,' need advice I'm considering whether or not to report my therapist for being unethical. I believe he is purposely trying to elicit a violent reaction from me in an effort to dismiss me from the psychotherapy program. 

He either undermines or dismisses the way I feel about something, and then when I confront him about the way he makes me feel, he always reminds me that I don't have to be there, and/or that talk therapy 'might not be for me.' He interrupts me in mid sentence when I'm trying to explain how I feel in regards to something that was brought up. Whenever I leave the clinic, I never feel like I accomplished anything, I feel angry and ashamed for opening up and appearing vulnerable, for nothing, and I begin ruminating about the likelihood of me ever finding some degree of stability in my life, which tends to drastically tilt my overall mood. 

Is this normal for a therapist to be so condescending for the overall way in which you feel? Am I missing something? I have serious trust issues, and it feels to me like he is being extremely insensitive on purpose, which is counter intuitive to attaining any sort of help from participating in talk therapy.

I'm anxious about things like my outfit, my makeup and mingling with a group of people they've been hanging out with a lot more. I've been at home for practically months, as I have REALLY BAD anxiety about being out in public, especially when it comes to seeing people I know and other girls that I end up comparing myself too. 

I know this sounds stupid but does anyone have tips on like acting normal and helping reduce anxiety?? Any tips help, thank you so much for reading! ",BPD
"Just ""broke up"" with my therapist. I've pretty much given up on myself. There's really no use and honestly I'm used to this shit so it doesn't even feel that bad most of the time. I'll just keep taking medication and deal with it and accept the fact that everyone leaves and no one sincerely cares about me. It's not like BPD is exactly curable. I'll just live the best life I can and eventually die. I don't think that's so bad.

My therapist tried to get me to continue treatment multiple times but eventually just shook my hand and wished me the best. He said he'd think about me. I think that's a load of horseshit. Will he call me up in a year and ask how I'm doing? No, and that's a fact. Even if I kill myself he'll live just fine and eventually forget. I just said okay. I think he knew what I was thinking, but what else can he say. ""Our time was up.""

Fuck that guy. And fuck me too. He was a good therapist. I'm just not that great a patient.

Anyways there goes another relationship I ran away from. Another person I pushed away. At this point I don't even feel anything. I'm just tired, of everything.",BPD
"I'd rather die than get over losing my FP. God damn I hate this disorder so much. My FP ghosted me over a month ago. I'm seriously unable to move on no matter how badly I want to. I spend hours every day just pondering methods of how I could contact her, the pros and cons, etc. The cons usually outweigh the pros, but then at some point my impulsive behavior will kick in and ignore the cons, and I'll try to contact her anyway. 

I wrote her a 6 page letter and had someone close to her review it to ensure that the content was appropriate. The letter was given to her, and I don't think that she ever read it. I don't even know what she thinks of me anymore, and it drives me fucking insane. I hate having BPD. I know that all of my thought processes are fucking insane, but I'm unable to control them. I just want to die. I know that everything about me is wrong, and I'll never be able to make it right.",BPD

"Need to stop myself from getting attached About a month ago my (now ex)-boyfriend broke up with me. I've been so down, went into a crisis and didn't leave my room until yesterday. I told myself I will not be getting involved with someone soon.
But.
I've been talking to another guy for months, just as friends(!!), but a little bird told me he kind of liked me already in August. 
Fast forward, I've been flirting with him on snapchat for the past weeks. I was thinking it couldn't hurt, he is far away and I'm single. I'm not getting attached.....
- And here comes the confusion.

You see, he's really into my body. He says I have a ""killer body"" and he is giving me compliments all the time. Not just about my body, but my face and talents too. Anyway, we met yesterday in a bar and held my hands (in front of all our friends) and wanted to be with me all night. He asked me if he could sleep at my house and I said yes, so we went home and all we did all night was talking and cuddling. No kissing, no sex. Just cuddling. He told me about his deepest darkest secrets, held my hands, and didn't touch my boobs or butt. 
Today he told me on snapchat that it was nice to have a place to stay, and the cuddling was just a bonus. I'm really confused. I think he is just as confused as me. He also said that sex was not an option last night, but on snapchat he's been like ""come and get me"" and reaaally flirty and sexual. I don't know how to react. 
I will also add that he's kind of tricky when it comes to emotions because he was hurt really bad after a breakup six years ago. Every time someone gets a little too close - he runs.

How BPD is like for me  Sometimes its all like that and goes this way and end like that. you go to the same road again and walk the same way again and not leading to any conclusion your life become like that an endless repetitions. and you question your being but not finding the answer because your questions don't even go beyond the level of knowledge nor does it reach out to any conclusion. You tremble and you fall again and you try to pick up the pieces but theres still pieces left behind and there's always pieces left unattached and each time you break you lose/ more pieces but you never fully recover and you will always broken.,BPD
"Getting angry when people don't listen to my TV recommendations. Tonight I recommended Breaking Bad to one of my closest friends. They told me they had seen the pilot and weren't motivated enough to keep watching. I got extremely angry and told them that I would end the friendship and bring them social isolation and harm if they didn't watch the show.

Took a step back and cooled off.

"We dont love ourselves enough.. We don't love ourselves at all. Most of is have some crazy hobby or still fill the void where self love should be, trying to coax someone in to fill the void with our talents or persuasion. 

We feel worthless because we decide to be. We develop coping mechanisms that rival superpowers. Forged in hell we seek new trials to overcome, never seeing us for what we have survived.

We are the sum of our experiences, the decisions that helped us survive the hells we were warped by, whatever abuse at whomevers hand, we were not born this way and do not have to remain this way.

At your darkest hour there is one person who can give younlove and care for you: you. But only of you choose to love and be loved, to do love is to be love. 

So instead of feeling sorry for yourself, reach out to another poor wretch. Be as selfish as you can, to do good is to love yourself, there is no more purely selfish pleasure to become love.

Abandon fear, if you die alone tomorrow you can die in love with yourself. To love yourself you must take every opportunity to affirm love, not seek it out. Sacrifice gladly if it will help those you love, but do not become a charity case of codependence. Do unto yourself as you would do unto others. And treat everyone with love and charity.

"The rage I went into that still lives on [trigger warning: sexual assault] So my best friend and I were travelling together for two months in Asia. Two weeks before we were headed back to Canada, it was 4/20. We missed the Canadian tradition but since drugs are extremely outlawed and strictly prohibited in the Philippines we figured we wouldn't get any. 

We actually did, miraculously, and we smoked at a lagoon. 

We had the most fun time on a white sand beach by ourselves spinning around in the water and playing like we were kids. It started raining and we laid on the shoreline as the waves lapped at our waists. It hadn't rained since we left Canada and it felt amazing. 

Shortly after, my best friend suddenly got stung by a box jellyfish. This is where everything went wrong. 

She ran out of the water and fell into the sand, clutching her arm. We could see the tentacles delivering electricity into her as we pulled them out, they stung our fingers as they came off. 

We raced to the bar on the beach where we had befriended the workers (two bar tenders and a band who played every night). They immediately gave us vinegar which helps neutralize the acids in the venom. 

She already had a worsening ear infection (no access to drugs where we were) and now she has a major jellyfish sting. 

She wasnt doing well. 

That night she was in too much pain to sleep and left to the bar to get some drinks in her to help with the pain. I remember saying goodnight and being burnt out as hell. We had never separated more than a few meters from each other the entire time we travelled and I wish we never did. 

I remember waking up, not knowing what time it was, but checking to see if she had come to bed. She didn't. 

I remember seeing light in the windows when I felt her come to bed. I was too tired to say anything. 

When we woke up in the morning she told me the guitarist had raped her on the beach after they all fed her with alcohol, cigarettes and weed.
Her wounds were so much worse and filled with sand. 

We ended up going to the cops but there was no police where we were. We took a tiny boat through a storm and got soaked, only to find out that she'd have to return to the Philippines to go through with a conviction. We could do nothing. What's worse is the rapists friends were all milling around and she didn't want to see them. We requested they not be there but they did nothing to protect her from them and their stares and comments. 

That night she was so strong, although she cried and was in a lot of pain. She wrote him a letter about consent for him to find when he was released from his overnight stay in jail. 

She asked me to bring it there. 

Now I was absolutely filled with rage. I considered murdering him in cold blood but decided to go with police because I knew he wouldn't be alone. If he was, I might have done it. 

I went over and delivered my previous best friends letter about consent to two drunk bar dwellers (his friends) who were sitting in chairs on the beach. I told them to give it to him and they were like ""aight whatever"" 

I turned away to leave. I looked over my shoulder. I saw his guitar on the stage in the bar. He had told us it was his prized possession when we were all hanging out a few nights before. 

I ran up and stole that fucking thing. I ran down the beach a little and smashed it to absolute pieces as I screamed incoherently about how much I hate him. 

A man who was walking along the beach asked me if I was okay and I just grunted and left. 

I wish I could have burned down that whole fucking illegal bar. I dream of going back to that beach town and brutally murdering him all the time. ",BPD

"I don't wanna be alone but I feel trapped when I am with people When I'm alone I wanna be with people, meet new people, party and so on. But I'm terrified of feeling trapped and you know, having the obligation to meet these friends if they wanna hang and so on. That's why I have like two friends only that I've had for a long time. We are at the stage of not having to see each other all the time and it's ok to say no since I know they won't accually leave me. 

​

But I can't make new friends because even if I would wan't to get to know them better I can't. I panic and ghost them etc because I get anxiety and feel trapped. I sometimes make plans just to regret it seconds later and start to dreading what I just did. I highly prefer being the one visiting someone instead of them coming to my place. Because then I can leave when I wan't to. I can't just kick people out when they are at my place. 

​

It's the same when I like a guy and they start liking me back. The second they wan't me to I start splitting on them and feel suffocated, not knowing what I wan't.

That's why I prefer texting. I love texting and I do it to much. I wan't to write everytime I'm sad/happy/angry. I have send texts to my friends on my slit writs, saying I wanna die.

So I have to stop myself all the time, and I feel this extreme loneliness and hopelessness. Last week I isolated myself and kept my thoughts/feelings to myself since I for real didn't know what was real and what was just attentionseeking.

And I made a plan to kill myself the next day. It was weird because I felt sooo far away from the people loving me, since I had not talked to them) and I thought they wouldn't be so sad. So I legit thought that that day was my last. But that evening my best friends wrote and I couldn't help myself from talking and he said it's okay you can do this and if you go I'll be so sad. I suddenly felt connected again and I couldn't hurt him. So I didn't kill myself. I don't know if I would have gone through with it but maybe I would have. I still wanna die and I'm making plans again. But I can't know if it's all attention or not and I can't go tell people ""I'm gonna kms"" all the time. So I guess we will find out one day lol",BPD
"Making friends with another pwBPD Hi there. 26yo female pwBPD here. My favorite person and significant other (FP/SO) of one year still lives with his ex, who also has BPD. I couldn't stand to be around her at first because she was often bursting into tears and I experienced a lot of empathy for her—and also hated her with the same sort of self-loathing I had because of my own BPD symptoms. However, I'm glad I kept an open mind and worked through some of these issues in therapy and with my FP, so now me and his ex have formed a friendship. I figured the friendship would be tough, so I'm just here venting since I don't get to talk to my therapist for another week while she's on vacation. I'm upset with ex because she's been getting me, my FP, and her boyfriend to pay for a lot of small things lately because she's overwhelmed about debt, but then she went and got a tongue piercing yesterday. I understand how impulsivity plays a large role here, but she even said, ""don't judge me when I get my tongue pierced today because I said I didn't have money for food and you bought me lunch,"" and that shows total rationality and forethought—and I know she's manipulating me. I have 50k of student debt for my two degrees—I need to save money too—and I'd have more money for frivolous stuff like tongue piercings if I constantly manipulated my friends into buying me stuff and then telling them not to judge me for it. I thought having a friend with BPD would be nice because we could share common ground, but she refuses to get therapy because she ""knows too much about it"" and I'm thinking I should back away slowly and carefully. I'm too sensitive to put myself in this easy position to get hurt. She only hits me up when she needs a ride or another favor, and while she can be a very empathetic and fun friend, I need to see the nuance of what's taking a negative toll on my emotional well-being.",BPD

"How to deal with sexuality well i have two moods. 

\- i'm very horny so i want to have sex right now and it doesn't matter with who or even with which gender. i'm into kinky and sick, dangerous things so much.

so yea i guess both are wrong and i guess i need to find a right path but it's not easy because when i'm in one of these moods i don't want to move to the other direction. i mean when i'm disgusted i don't want to change it, moreover i want to feel more of it and i want to tell people that i'm disgusted and i'm pretty sure that i will be disgusted forever.

"Looking for a place to talk I've read the rules and I understand them. 

I'm seeking guidance both professionally and informally. I am very early in this process but I am finding that writing things down and getting them into a coherent format rather than the jumbled mess that is in my head is both cathartic and useful. I just visited /r/mentalhealth and made a similar post there. I was looking through the linked sites from there and found this forum. I am not diagnosed BPD and am not looking for such. I'm also not in a state of mind where I feel capable of understanding what BPB is by researching. I'm also aware of how dangerous that might be in forming preconceptions prior to therapy or diagnosis.

All of that being said, I feel trapped. There are things I know about myself and suspect about myself that I am only starting to face due to another crisis that I believe to be unrelated but I'm willing to have an open mind about that. As a form of self therapy I've been writing down my thoughts. Some of those thoughts or the ways that I've been using to describe those thoughts I can see from a dispassionate viewpoint and see that they might be taken as odd. I feel that it is just as likely and probably more likely that those thoughts are just the way I chose to express them. When I read the link to this forum, it just sort of jumped out at me as it resonated with those thoughts and expressions. Others did too regarding anxiety and panic but this one is more of a curiosity.

I came here to see if I might be able to discuss these things that I've been pondering and see that they are against the rules. This is why I feel trapped. I feel compelled to discuss further but can't, I'm too early in therapy for it to be meaningful, I'm too messed up to do my own research, and I'm not sure I should be doing any of these things.

"Why? *self harm trigger warning My ex suffers from untreated BPD, and I must admit that the past year of my life has resulted in the second biggest heartbreak of my life, trauma, and more than likely PTSD. After she broke up with me because she was insanely jealous of one of my close female friends(probably closest friend in general), all I wanted was for us to sit down like reasonable adults and sort out our differences because I loved, and still do love, her. Well, she did try to get me back, but there was always an episode. First, it was a pregnancy that I'm still not even sure existed because when I asked her a due date and for permission to go to the doctor's with her, I was met with a resounding ""fuck off"". She even threatened an abortion if I didn't cut the aforementioned friend from my life. Still, I was ready to help her raise this kid. As I predicted, she eventually had a miscarriage. That was followed by a supposed suicide attempt, running 400 miles away making people think she committed suicide, slashing the hell out of her arms because she thought I was out with a girl, then when I got to her apartment she told me to take her back or say I didn't love her or she'd actually kill herself, and a final meeting where I tried to mend fences, but all she did was put me down, bring up that same friend, and left me crying at a table. Why?   


As somebody who suffers from mental health issues, I refuse to believe that all of this is due to her having BPD. Stigmas are often harmful to those who suffer from whichever illness said stigma is attached to, and I just can't believe that all of this was due to BPD. This isn't a sub I frequent, but I guess I'm just looking for answers that will help me move on. Is she just a bad, selfish person?

We were passing every day getting to know each other and something fantastic was beggining. Less than a year later she came to visit me in my country. We spent time together and It was amazing.

A year later she left her home to study on Erasmus for a semester. It was her first time being away from home for a long time. She suffered emotionally on what I think was some variation of homesickness, maybe extream, crippling homesickness. To my shock and horror, our one and a half year long distance relationship, and our habbits and ways changed. Toward me she changed. She went from being the most loving person to withdrawn and apathetic. She told me that her love for me was gone and she was going through something. At the same time she told me not to worry and thimgs will be okay. I worried. We went from being so close to talking far less. When we talked she would consciously decide to leave after a short while. She was keeping up with me but in small rations. After about two months, I remember there was a phone call. We talked for long and things had come back to normal. She seemed to be over that spell and we were back to normal. A few weeks later I came there and we lived together for a month. Again, this was magical.

We went on as usual long distance until about eight months later, with our relationship almost two and a half years old at that stage, when I came to stay with her in another city in her country. We stayed together for three weeks. During It her homesickness came back strong. We had great moments but arguments came. One day she was overwhelmingly upset. She told me that she was breaking up with me. Her personality, demeanour, caring and everything changed right before my eyes. She became very cold. Before I left to come back to my country there was a reconciliation and intimacy again. But still she was a different person with very clear and evident traits. Over two months passed with her acting like this toward me. She said things like that she didn't know what she wants and that I should be under no obligation to wait for her.

Again, It passed. Like before, there was an epiphany phone call with her passionately talking about our future and I knew the loving girlfriend had come back. Over the next nine months I visited her in her city, met all her family and things were excellent. She arranged to come to my city for a year's working contract.

She has been here for two months. At the first few weeks we were spending around four days per week together, while I'd stay with her until she fell asleep. She became busier and the went to one or two days per week. We've had some great times and spend a wonderful weekend in another city here. There had been some arguments. I'd define them as smallish, manageable and kinda normal for a couple. She told me that she is going through hard times and isn't very comfortable at work but I think most importantly, she is painfully missing her family and home. 

One day she told me that she wanted to break up. She said among everthing she can't take the pressure of the relationship. She called be obsessive, which I really disagree with and would call illogical. I sometimes made mistakes by being moody temporarily. I feel like I'm human and find It hard to be exactly perfect all the time. But mostly I am caring, mature and a very good boyfriend. If I read back the messages from the days before the break up I can see her calling me those things and saying that she loves and misses me.

It's been ten days and we are barely speaking. I've tried to communicate and invited her out but she either makes an excuse or ignores me. I have been here before and seen her come back to me but in the position I'm in right now, I've no idea what will happen. We talked about marriage and the future. Even in the days before the break up she was making future plans for next year. It makes no sense that her break up decision is logical. She made clear that me, and we were everything that she wants for the future. Her and her family talked openly about us as a married couple.

I'm trying to apply sense. The closest thing which seems to fit the behaviour is borderline personality disorder. Some of the traits match closely. Here's a quote from a BDP website

""Disrupted Relationships: tumultuous relationships with a person close to you that vary from extreme fear of abandonment to episodes of excessive anger and the desire to get away from that person.""

That explains It very accurately. The part I'm confused about is the desire to get away. One day she loved and missed me, then she wants to have nothing to do with me.

In my life, I've nobody who has experience or knowledge of BDP. I'm not even sure if this is BDP. But if you have any advice or insight, please comment.",BPD
"Haven't self harmed in 473 days but can't get rid of the urge today I am raging inside. Someone recently posted that they felt like their insides were on fire and that's how I feel. I bounce between feeling so completely disconnected from any emotion to intense anger right now...shrieking out of frustration in public on the sidewalk for no noticeable reason, feeling like I am so full of energy that won't escape.

ARGHHHHHHH. Posting here to see if it helps to connect because I'm totally holding on but by a thread. ",BPD
"I'm afraid of getting into a relationship So I have this ""friend"", we both know the other one wants to be more then friends, but we haven't seen us since it's absolute clear and we both say we want to get to know each other better before starting something.

But know I know how it ends every time when I start to trust someone and feel comfortable with them, they can hurt me that easily and I get mad on them so fast. Think you guys know what I mean.

I haven't told him that I have BPD yet, Idk if I should. I want him to know what he may has to go through but I also don't want to destroy my chances. I also don't know if it is a good idea to start a relationship, I don't want to hurt him or myself and I'm afraid it the whole relationship will be hurting and it will hurt even harder when its going to end.",BPD
"I'm so in love with a girl who's boyfriend is my friend. Please help. I don't know what to do. I love this girl so much. She's the most caring, kind, and thoughtful person I know. I don't know anyone else who's as relatable and empathetic to my situation as she is. She also suffers from BPD, which I think helps her understand me better. I'm so comfortable talking to her, more so than anyone else in my life. 

The problem is that she's dating one of my friends, and he isn't too keen on dating her, but I don't think she knows. I don't want their relationship to end because I know it'll destroy her, I just want happiness for her. At the same time though, I really want to let her know how I feel. I'm stuck, I don't know what to do. Please help me.",BPD
"Not sure if I'm even allowed to be this upset... I feel like my partner has no respect for my belongings.

I have such an intense attachment to my things, so I'm majorly upset when they get broken. It feels like he breaks my things a lot.

He's broken favourite mugs, gifts from friends, lost my driving license last week...This morning he knocked a mirror off the wall and broke my clock. 

I fucking love this clock. It was a gift from my mum, one of those retro cat clocks with the swinging tail. It's stopped ticking. I've been trying to fix it a while and it doesn't work anymore.

His reaction? ""Oh...Sorry. It was an accident though."" Before walking off.

So I'm here in a teary mess, upset beyond reason because gifts from loved ones are so so important to me. My therapist says that I shouldn't see these gifts as a representation of our relationship, so I guess that's why it hurts so much. I feel fucking DEVESTATED, it's pathetic. 

EDIT: I've been diagnosed with ""quiet"", or inward-acting BPD, not sure if that makes things any more understandable for anyone..",BPD
"I'm tired of being hurt after a break-up when the other person is relieved or just feels guilty. I've had 4 serious relationships. Some more serious than others, obviously. I would say that I ""loved"" two of them. With one of those two telling me that they loved me too. Like most relationships, they ended in a break-up. And being someone with BPD, the ending was massive, devastating, and miserable.... for me. It's always been the other person to break up with me. 

​

For two of them, it was a relief for the other person. My BPD and mental health issues exhausted them and even caused them their own depression. I don't really blame them for that. One the guy just didn't have real romantic feelings, so he just felt ""sad"" because he was guilty that he made me miserable after the break-up. The last guy broke up with me because I was moving and he didn't want to do distance, when I did want to try. He knew that he didn't want to do distance, so he tried to not develop that many romantic feelings, but he said that maybe it was a mistake that we sort of ""dated"" because he did develop feelings (and I loved him, I think, I never told him) and it made the break-up much harder. He's great at repressing emotions, so a week after we broke up he said that he wanted to be friends. I was still devastated and told him that I had to be alone. He told me that he was sad that he made me miserable (ie, he felt guilty). 

​

Recently had a friends with benefits thing with a guy I met in July. It was a bad idea from the beginning. He told me about how he was broken for years after his break-up from his first gf. But that he's over it. Except that he now has trouble feeling emotions. Long story short, I obviously developed feelings for him because FWB never works. But obviously he didn't feel the same way. I know he likes me as a friend (minus the sex). But I told him that I couldn't talk to him anymore because I knew he didn't have feelings for me. Obviously I was hurt (still am... it was this morning). He didn't say much except that he felt sad because of what is happening. He texted me when I was on my way home asking how I was and how he feels ""awful for what I did to you and that you are sad"" and ""I'm sorry"". Dude. You're sad because you're guilty. 

​

Add another one to my pile of rejections and break-ups of people who didn't feel anything. Now I'm going to see a guy from Tinder because that's the unhealthy way that I cope with things. Fantastic. Cheers.",BPD
"So frustrating when you're calm and collected normally and say, ""I will act calm during any confrontations or arguments"" but act the complete opposite when it happens and then feel intense shame and embarrassment afterwards I feel really ashamed when it happens, but during an episode, I have this, ""I've already screwed everything up, so who cares if I fuck this up too!"" mentality and act so irrational, immature and enraged. Then, when I'm fine and all calm, I sit and think, ""wow, I can not believe I acted that way......"" It's like being two completely different people and it is scary... Anybody else relate?",BPD
"Need advice I notice when I get angry, I supress it. Which causes me to be passive aggressive to loved ones. I want to learn how to stop that. Anyone know any self help books about anger? How do you deal with anger? ",BPD
"How to talk to my bf w/ BPD re: his accusations that I'm cheating or up to no good? Hey guys, lurker here! I am subscribed to lots of the bpd related subreddits in hopes to better understand my 30M boyfriend and the effect that bpd has on our relationship. 

Lately I feel as if he's been hyper-focused on my phone activity. He thinks I'm texting other guys when I'll be responding to a work groupchat about shift coverage, or he gets paranoid when I'm scrolling through my facebook or watching Snapchat stories. I try to explain what it is I'm doing on my phone, but he is seriously always looking over my shoulder asking who I'm talking to or what I'm doing. It's so frustrating. 

When I try to tell him he needs to chill out with the questioning and subliminal accusations, he tells me I'm being defensive. But I'm seriously not doing anything wrong! He's demanded to go through my phone a few times, but that is one of my boundaries I enforce to protect my sense of self and privacy in this relationship.  I have conversations with my family and friends that he doesn't need to snoop through — Whether I'm confiding in them or they're confiding in me, it's not his place to read our messages. I will tell him what I'm doing or who I'm talking to, but I'm starting to get really fed up with always having to tell him what I'm doing on my phone. I don't even like using it around him anymore because it triggers him so much, but he's always on his phone so I just bring mine out to occupy my time. 

Sometimes I wonder if it's just his paranoia or fear of abandonment getting the best of him or if he's projecting and up to no good on his phone. I don't mention this to him because he'll have an extreme reaction and we'll have another hours-long fight over something inconsequential. 

I'm hoping someone from this community has some tips on how I can better address this situation without having to give in to his demands to go through my phone to prove my innocence? I'll be very clear, I am not talking to other guys nor have I cheated on him ever. So I'm not sure where this is coming from but it's wearing on me and I'm not sure how much more I can put up with it. I love him and I want our relationship to work out but his insecurity and paranoia is really getting to me. 

Pls help me figure out how to navigate this without triggering him or making him feel as if I am criticizing him! Thank you! ",BPD
"What meds are you on and are they helpful? Or weight gain? I need to go back on meds but really don't want to. The last ones I were on was a combo of low dose Risperdal and an anti-anxiety I can't remember. I tried anti-depressants (Zoloft, Paxil) and those weren't helpful at all for me. 

What meds have you found to be effective? I really don't want to gain weight so I'm reluctant to go back on Risperdal or any other hard hitting anti-psychotic. But curious what other people's experiences have been with BPD dx and psychotropics. ",BPD

"I could use some help understanding a ""friend"" ? of mine I am struggeling to understand whats really going on and would reaaaally appreciate some help/inside.

So to make it as short as possible while hopefully still sticking to the important stuff: (excuse my english pls iam not a native speaker)

So iam  M24 and diagnosed with Schizoid PD, was hospitalized beginning of the year and met a F21 with bpd that ticked boxes i didnt even knew i had. We were pretty close for like 7 weeks straight till i litterly ran away from her place bc i paniced. Easily biggest Mistake of my Life so far. She was incredible understanding at that time and didnt really show if/how much i hurt her. 
1Month later of  increasing amounts of suicidal texts i decided to commit suicide. I was homeless, super deppressiv and suicidal and hated me for the last 3years, the therapy didnt do shit and to be honest my fuck up besides knowing what my actions would inflict on her pushed me over the edge. 
Well i fucked that one up too. Obviously. That was back in Frebruary. Didnt have any contact with anyone who knows her for like 6 plus months.

Now she texted me out of the blue last month and asked about everything and revealed she knew about my suicide attempt since like 2 days after. So we catched up with our lifes , but she almost always ignored question about how shes doing right now and sometimes told me straight she is currently trinking, self harming and fucking around everyday. But it seemed friendly and positive in tone - till she wanted to know everything about my suicide attempt.
Like where did i get the poison,how did it feel and so on.

Honestly i dont wanna talk about this stuff, i dont wanna think about it, iam activly repressing everything about that decision and usually iam good at it. So i tried to ignore/block any question about it
And out of the blue she told me she doesnt believe me, wy didnt i retry to kill myself and if i had proof. 

Boom. i snapped and told her to fuck her self for asking me this crap.  ( i know i know, i mean i didnt keep my cool coulda handled this stuff way better)


Now she deleted me again but send me a last text asking wy she ""even had real interest how i am "". 

-----------
 I wanna apologize for me snapping at her again but dont even know how or if i should or even right now or aaaaaaah man iam so  freaking frustrated right now.
She is admittetly not trying to get better and i have 0 idea how to reach her or if i even should, considering that ive got the feeling i always fuck it up bc i myself cant handle me.

"No, I don't have low self esteem darling... I have deeply pervasive core shame. I am worthless. You are better than me; everyone is. How? By being themselves of course! I should change myself to suit you. We will never be equals. My needs, my interests, my hobbies, my preferences should all be acceptable to you, or even better, be yours! Will you love me then? Oh you do already? Well fuck that, no you don't. Remember that time you lied to me? See, that's proof you don't. Or that one time I told you I don't like chocolate cake and you bought me one for my birthday? It wasn't an accident, you just don't love me enough to care. But you still come back and tell me you love me everyday and show me. Ugh, I hate liars. So unattractive. I hate you. I need to find someone else who won't do this to me. Time to go out and meet them. Oh they're so perfect, they tell me they love me and they haven't let me down once! I don't care that we've only known each other a week, they love me so much more than you ever did. It's time to break up with you so I can live with them. Oh you think that's a good idea for us to split too? See, I knew you didn't love me. You should have fought for us. You just said that because you wanted to keep your ego from being hurt? HA! I would never do that. Ok, maybe I do sometimes. But my behaviour doesn't count, right? You know how much I love you! You could've trusted my consistency, but I couldn't trust yours. That's just how it is, and oh how I wished it were different.

You're gone now darling. I told you everything I hated about you when you left, just so you felt as shitty as I. But you know what I forgot to tell you? That I loved your big, beautiful, blue eyes. The way you gave to everyone else but never for that accolades, you just did it because you were a good person. Or the way you bought me the chocolate you know I liked the best. Or that you helped me when I cried. Or the way I knew there was something special about you from the minute I laid eyes on you. Or the fact that you were uniquely, quirky, wonderful you. 

I have a cancer of the soul. It seeps into my veins and strikes my brain with great force.  Treatment might work, but the chances of remission are high. But I'm going to fight for you my darling. I want you by my side, because I've never loved anyone like you. The selfless kind, where Im sadly accepting we may be better off apart. I want you to have the life you deserve, with or without me. My soul cancer might kill me, but thank you for for the short time that you made me feel alive.

EDIT: Wow, guys. Thanks for the love and the GOLD. I'm glad others can relate to my level of crazy. But in all seriousness, I hope this brings a sense of understanding for people on both sides of this horrible disorder. 

To the people with BPD; I understand your pain. It's ok to feel when sometimes others don't. You're ok. I understand. It's hard to change thought patterns, but I don't think it's impossible. Believe in yourself and be kind to others (and you). This is a shame based disorder, and I promise you won't heal if you feed it with more shame. 

To the partners; you deserve a standing ovation just for being here, and seeking understanding. I'm sorry if our behaviour is confusing to you at times. We love you, but don't stay if you are being abused. Set strict boundaries. There is never too much communication for this disorder. You have to be a very special person to love a person with BPD. Take this as a thank you for every time you deserved appreciation but you didn't get it. 

To Kate, my love; I'm sorry it felt like you couldn't make a mistake or that it felt I was trying to catch you out all the time. It's not untrue, I was. I'm just so sure you couldn't really love me and had to prove it to myself with any trivial shit I could find. Thank you for all the times you did forgive me and talking me through my warped perceptions. You didn't deserve all the accusations. I hope he takes care of you, and tells you how much he loves all the things I know you're insecure about. Please remember the opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference. And you are just way too good to be indifferent about. ",BPD
first date I went on my first real date last nice and it was amazing. I could talk your ear off about it. And today is the day after the date and all day we've been talking and flirting but I just feel like he's not into me anymore. Even though we set up a second date I still feel like he's doing it just to be nice. He texted me and for some reason it feels like he's done with me you know? Just because he didn't use any emojis or whatever ugh. I know it's stupid but I just feel so dumb for putting myself in this situation. I always tell myself not to get too clingy and to be cool but I just can't help it you know? I really wish I could just be normal and not fucking like this. ,BPD

"Struggling with friends who need to drink to have fun Hey all

I'm 26 years old female and recovering from bpd. I also suffer from chronic pain (fibromyalgia) which I manage through diet, taking care of myself, dealing with stress and mindfulness. I also got rid of my chronic fatigue with diet too. 

This means I can't drink much any more. The thing is I'm in the UK, anyone from Britain knows what it's like here, people drink ALL the time.

 First I was sad because I couldn't drink often, just like them I needed booze to have fun. 
Now I'm sad because it seems like once again I don't fit in with anyone. 

I wanna go on walks or talk and meet up for a coffee. 
My sexually impulsive bpd characteristics have gone and I am finally becoming happier with myself because I barely drink . 

Giving up drinking had helped me so much psychically and mentally, but now I'm not longer a party animal I'm struggling to fit in once again...

"Dreams of Narcissists, Abandonment, and Forgotten Love [long/complicated/rant/vent] TL;DR: Complete 180 on my attitude towards former narcissistic FP after a 2-yr remission, borderline obsessed again literally overnight, completely and ridiculously based on a few dreams. Annoyed with myself and my feelings and my brain for dreaming this shit.

This weekend was rough in terms of dreams and nightmares. 

Backstory: I was obsessed with my narcissistic FP for a good 6 years, broke the friendship/semi-romantic relationship off in 2016 when I realized that he was a horrible, terrible narcissist taking advantage of my devotion. 

Long story short, I dared call him out on some really N behaviors, and he used the one tool that he knew would take my knees out from under me - abandonment. He told me ""it was best we part ways"" and told me to never speak to him again. 

It was devastating. Life-changing. Not my proudest moments, I begged him to reconsider, begged him to give me another chance, pleaded like my life depended on it. He said he had made an irrevocable decision.

He 100% and absolutely knew how badly this would hurt me, especially in the manner in which he did it. I had always been pretty up-front with him about my fears of abandonment, and just a month earlier, I distinctly recall vocalizing that ""my worst nightmare is someone just waking up one day and abandoning me forever"". And you can guess that he stored that information away for future use.

Someone I thought was my best friend and that I thought loved me transformed into the most manipulative narcissist I've ever met, practically overnight. I finally saw his inner sour for what it was, and his spell over me was broken.

Since he said get lost, I did. I blocked him on reddit, steam, text, all social media. I disappeared from every form of communication we ever had. I don't think he counted on me taking him so seriously, but hey, black and white thinking right? We're either the best of friends, or the worst of enemies.

Unbeknownst to me, since about a month after our falling out, he had been messaging me via various social medias. I had him blocked/ignored everywhere, so I got none of these messages. I had no idea he was trying to contact me because I did what he told me to do, right? He said get lost, I got lost. Forever.

This went on for about 10 months, until eventually, he went to the lengths of creating new accounts to specifically message me. I unblocked him from my main accounts, and found 10 months worth of messages asking to talk, asking how I was, saying he missed me, yada yada. I was somewhat stunned to find the roles reversed, and now he desperately wanted me in his life.

Whether or not it was right for me to acknowledge one of his messages in Dec 2016, since then, I've kept him at arm's length, never any personal discussions, no more x-rated photos or chats, and I never, ever initiate contact (well...until now...read on). He messages me about once a week these days with random non-sequitur commentary designed to engage me. I usually give one-word answers and/or try to antagonize him for my own amusement. 

Anyways, I thought all my ""feelings"" for him were dead and gone. Knowing what I know about him, how could I possibly care about him, let alone love him? As of last Friday afternoon, I could honestly, 100% and truly say that I gave less than two shits about him. I would even see his messages, and unintentionally forget about them -- a far cry from the girl who checked her phone 176 times a day to see if he messaged her.

Enter, my dreaming brain.

Friday night's dream was a rehash of our falling out. In my dream, we fought, as we had in real life, and again, he cut me out. Blocked me entirely. I remember the emotions flowing through my dream, the sense of being bereft, a viscerally nauseous sense of abandonment, the feeling that something was slipping through my fingers again. Every ounce of that yearning, horror, and despair of the day he left me came rushing back full force. In my dream I was trying so hard to hold on to him. I kept thinking, ""not again!"".

I woke up missing him intensely. Nostalgic. Yearning. Missing him. Wanting to reach out to him immediately. Tell him I missed him, loved him. Make sure he was still there. I tried my best to shake it off, but I was obsessed with him, with the dream, all day. I don't know where these feelings crawled out from...again, a complete 180 in feelings from the past 1.5 years.

I had a few drinks on Saturday night, which was a bad idea, as it resulted in me getting even MORE nostalgic and MORE obsessed, and I decided to send him a message, a picture (just of me smiling) and a message that said ""I dreamed about you last night"". Nothing else. I wanted him to take the bait. I wanted him to be surprised to see a message from me, to lure him in again with my smile, which he always loved. Thus began the obssessive phone-checking. Did he message me now? What about now? How about now, maybe?

Joke was on me, as it's now 36 hours later and I have no response (he hasn't even seen it yet). 

Despite the lack of response, Saturday night was a full-on dreamfest about him. This time, it was a version of reality from when we loved each other deeply, accepted each other as the other's soul mate, we were a team now and forever. It was some altered timeline from after our big falling out, where we had gained back the trust we had in one another, something I could never do in real life. In the dream, I was on the phone with him and referred to ""back when we were engaged"" (we were never engaged, never even in a formally defined bf/gf relationship). In the dream, he paused and said ""when we were engaged?"" and I said ""yes, you know, back then"" and he said (with all the nonsense that dreams have) ""we never defined it like that, but I agree with you, we were engaged"". 

In my dream it was music to my ears! He felt the same way I did! He felt so strongly about me that he wanted to acknowledge that we were engaged! I thought my heart would burst with happiness, we were together again, a team, a happy union of soulmates.

As one might predict, this left an even rosier impression of the situation when I woke up. Now not only was I curious and interested in talking to him, I had started feeling a special connection and kinship with him again. Started smiling when I thought of him. Forgetting all those quirks (read: narcissistic tendencies) and white-washing everything about our time together, how he made me laugh and feel alive and challenges me mentally, and how we click and fit together just right...I would even wager I dipped a toe or two into infatuation.

All of this without any involvement or intervention from him. HE HASN'T SPOKEN TO ME IN OVER A WEEK, yet my brain is as good as convinced we're back together in the old way. I am terrified of when he will respond to my message, I feel both embarrassed that I sent a message acknowledging that I had a dream about him (two dreams, now) and potentially thrilled and excited to hear from him. I've started watching my phone again, just like the old days. Checking his ""last online"" like clockwork.

I am SO FRUSTRATED with myself for getting so carried away because of a few dreams. Annoyed at how easily my position of ""don't care about him anymore"" turned into ""I love him and have always loved him and will always love him"". But the emotions are there. I get butterflies every time I check my phone. 

It's going to take everything I've got not to fall back into his clutches again. I fear I am losing already, given the communication I sent, and the picture. He will eventually see it, and I will eventually be asked to explain my dream, and even I don't know what will happen then.

The end :(

"I'm spiraling and I don't know what to do So the past two weeks have been a whirlwind. I've been splitting on my mom and friends. 

Recently I confessed my feelings to my fp who told me he doesn't have the same for me. He's the only person I talk to and from our text messages I thought he'd feel the same. Now that I know he doesn't I'm hurt and I feel off. I want to kill myself to be quite honest. Of course I'm not going to do it but I'm so devastated that I don't know what to do. Recently he's been busy with work so he doesn't talk to me anymore. I'm constantly left alone with my thoughts and I can't leave my house so I'm just alone all the time. My antidepressants don't work anymore, my next psychiatrist appointment isn't for weeks I feel like I'm going to break soon and I don't know if I can handle it…

"stilnoct + sobril I took 10mg of Stilnoct and 15mg Sobril last night because I wanted to be wellrested before my first therapy appointment. I thought everything had gone well, I slept soundly and everything was alright. I thought it was a good combo.

Then my friend went ""I laughed like crazy when I got your videos""

.... videos??? VIDEOS????

I had apparently been liveblogging my hallucinations (?) where I saw elfs, italians, greeks and at one point I went ""I look like the sun. Worship me""

"Why did I even look at his Instagram page lmao TW: rape, suicidal thoughts/thoughts of hurting myself 

I signed up to tinder just to see who's out there as I recently got out of a shitty relationship. I'm not ready to date anyone or even have a FWB or ONSs because ya know BPD and all that, but I just wanted to see all the cuties in my area. One of the lads that came up was the dude who raped me, obviously I swiped a hard no on that one.

However it was complicated, when I was 14 I thought I was in love with him, obsessive in fact. I got involved with him, but he was in a relationship. When I found out he said he wouldn't leave her so it mutually ended. A few years later I thought we could be friends despite me feeling this pull towards him and when he tried it on with me again and I rejected him (he had a girlfriend, surprise surprise), he raped me. Not only that but I was fucking stupid enough to see him again because of this stupid deep rooted love/feelings I had and he raped me again in front of his friend. When I was on my own with the friend and crying, telling him I didn't want it, the friend just said ""oh that's what he's like, we just accept it"". I blocked him on everything, and hoped I'd never have to see or talk to him again ever. It hasn't stopped me from thinking about him though. So today when I saw his tinder profile I thought I'd check out his IG. Lmao what a fucking mistake.

I went to 6th form/college (ages 16-18 idk what that is in the US) a little out the way so all my friends aren't in the area, but on his most recent post he's interacting with a girl who's friends with my best friends from college, and they're arranging to meet up. I've typed out messages to my friends but I can't send them because we haven't actually spoken properly in a while and also I don't want them to tell this girl, then they say who I am, and it get back to the guy. No one believed me when I first told his friends anyway even though one of them was there, and if she says to them I'm lying then... I won't be able to take it. Alternatively if they start dating and he meets my friends it'll all be fucking over because I can't be friends with them while he's in their lives. I know all of this is hypothetical but I'm now fucking triggered and want to hurt myself. I have two young kids so suicide is out of the question (luckily for everyone I suppose I'm glad I can be rational now I have children) but I just want to go and make myself throw up until I pass out. I don't have anything to cut with but I wish I did. God I fucking hate him.

"Shitstorm involving social services (TW:CSA) I made a post about being really happy I'm about to receive therapy soon.

But I told the therapist my situation.  My brother sexually abused me when I was 6, and he was 11.  And that I'm having to live at home, with my mum and dad, and my brother and his two kids (he's been evicted from his rented place 'cause he couldn't afford it).

They've taken the kids to their office.  They're about to come over to investigate.  They've made a mistake, though.  They think that I said that my brother was also sexually abused, which isn't true.  Otherwise, the kids would be able to stay with me, and my mum and dad.  But now they probably suspect my mum and/or dad of sexually abusing my brother, which never happened.

It's a complete fucking shitstorm.  I'm freaking out badly.  I don't know if I could live with myself if they took the kids away permanently.  I don't know why they think my brother was sexually abused - I never said that - and I don't know how the hell the kids are right now.

I have to explain to them that I never said that.  My brother will probably have to move out.

I'm terrified.  This is why I never said anything for so long, about the abuse, because I was scared my brother's kids would be taken away.  I know he's not a threat to them.  He was a fucked up kid, and is suicidal over what he did to me, and would never, in my mind, abuse his children; never.  I have to explain this to them.

I've ruined everything.  This is my worst nightmare.  This was everything I was trying to avoid since the kids were born.

I mean, he hears me and I think he's trying to understand or listen but he doesn't get it and can't see it from my point of view so I end up feeling ignored. I know I split with people so my female room mate I up until yesterday was hating, Ive now internally made up with and we've been talking lots since. 

I told my husband through text I wasn't going to clean up after him anymore because I thought that if he cared enough he would do it himself but clearly he doesn't and I don't want him to rely on me to be housekeeper. He immediately gave excuses as to why he had not cleaned up (this is normal for when I ask him to do it himself) but then said I was talking shit about him to my room mate. 

To me that means being rude or mean about someone or saying untrue things, but I told her I thought his feelings were not meant to be rude and he just didn't see it as important as I do. I don't think I said anything that constitutes ""talking shit"" and I was just venting to a friend. He still isn't taking responsibility for cleaning up and is being rude to me about the whole thing because now that the disorder isn't leaning in his favor, he forgets it exists and hates my behavior.

"DAE have an insatiable urge to angry text the therapist between sessions? I find myself constantly thinking about sending the therapist angry texts. This is particularly galling since I can't always identify anything new to complain about. I've started to feel really ridiculous and overdramatic for these thoughts, some of which I act on. Right now, it's taking everything in me to resist texting the therapist. I already know exactly what I would say, and she would say it is making a threat, which is bad. I am really trying to be strong and not text the therapist any more. I especially feel like I need to not text her this week, as I sent her numerous angry texts, including threats, last week. I have many conflicts with the therapist, but so far, she takes me seriously when I say things. I do not want her to become complacent due to me angry texting her too frequently.

"So what's wrong with me. I'm aware of certain things that happen in my brain when it comes to other people. I get crushes very easily. I love fast and I love hard not just sexually friendships too. I am always open about 50% of my life. Well I met this guy online. I fell hard and fast with him. Since my ex I have major trust issues, self esteem issues and I'm BPD to boot. This guys seems amazing. He says the right things 80% of the time. He's gorgeous, he's funny, he pushes me to take action. We have never met but we talk all of our spare time, we watch movies together, we play video games together and uuuhhh other things. I know quite a few ppl who have met their husbands this way so I know it's possible this could be real. He never seems shady or like he's living a secret life. I don't know how to tell if it's real or not. Am I in love or is it another addiction. He's all I think about! I dream of him all dreams I remember. I started dreaming about things I have long give up on in my life. He set this spark off in me. I'm also extremely turned on by him which really freaks me out,as like I said we haven't met, and with a few words OMG my body betrays me. So if this is real how do I get past this sex craze feeling until we get to meet in person? How do I keep my distorted views from ruining this?

"Black and white thinking and anxiety has ruined everything 😒 Hey guys so I have been diagnosed with bpd for two years now. 

I have just started to be able to function (kind of) in the real world, getting work, going for trials, interviews etc to get a second job. I still get constant anxiety at my first job and I've been there for three months then sometimes I get super comfortable. I just always feel so unstable and so changeable. My moods, who I am, the way I talk to people, the way I perceive the world, my thoughts, my beliefs, my feelings everything! 

Anyway tonight I had my first shift at a new job and I was so anxious all day. Last night I had a trial and thought everyone there was against me but pushed through it and when I think rationally, I really enjoyed it. I need Valium to calm myself down or I have panic attacks and spiral out of control and self destruct but my doctor won't give me any more Valium so now I'm on high alert constantly. I only take quarter of a tablet when I get super anxious and it helps so much. 

Anyway tonight I was sooo anxious and I don't know I just totally turned on the club I'm meant to be starting at and thinking of all this proof as to how they'll just use me and it'll be horrible etc. (it is a strip bar) I will be just waitressing and bartending in full uniform. I don't know part of me loves it all loves the environment, gorgeous women, making money etc part of me thinks it's sleazy and disgusting.

I'm sick of being all over the place!

I didn't rock up to my shift and texted my boss two hours later that I had a family emergency and that I was so sorry and that I understood if she didn't want to give me another shot but if she did I'd be able to prove to her that I'm reliable and would love to be part of the team. And that I'm free all next week and that I'll hopefully hear from her soon. They were super happy with me at the trials I did. 

Do you reckon if I call on Monday and apologise again it'll be okay? I've done everything right up until this point I want this job so bad and I've just gone and fucked it up for myself because of my stupid fucking brain.

One minute I feel confident and attractive the next I feel like the most disgusting think walking this earth. Help please!

"How to know who you are In the months since understanding my condition, the two most important things that seem to determine mine and your condition, is a lack of true identity and the desire for validation. Speaking for me personally, both of these things have always weighed heavy on me, and corrupted every action or inaction that has entered my mind. 

Am I truly generous or do I just want people to like me? 
Am I really a nice person or do I simply want people to see what I want them to see so they can like me more? 

As the questions with answers that could only inspire self doubt piled up, I soon began realizing I was asking the wrong questions. Which is what many of us do. Such as, ""what is the meaning of life?"". This implies only one answer exists and that is it has to exist rather than the meaning of life being subjective to you. 

Which of course, is just like our struggle with this disorder. 

I began asking myself ""Who I want to be"" and then comparing it to ""Who I am"" and ""Who I was"". 

Suddenly, answers became less negative and self defeating and more hopeful and consistent. 

I began to notice characteristics that I've always shared, some good and some bad. Then I began applying it to what I want to be and many of these bad traits and impulses began to disappear into my future. 

My humor stays with me in all 3 questions but my self doubt does not. 
My goals and aspirations stay with me in all 3 questions but not my impulse to give up. 

There is a quote that goes something like ""be better than you were yesterday and as good as you hope to be tomorrow"". 

This really helped me. 

In order to truly find out who I was, and what distinguishes me from the burden i carry like some concealed back pack, I began looking towards a future. 

None of us have to be defined by any of our negative qualities. It's hard for me many times to remember accomplishments and connect with them but once I remember why I ever accomplished those traits in the first place, (which was for the future me) I was easily able to continue. 

For example: before 5 or 6 months ago I was always wishing to be in good shape but I never believed in the future or trusted it. But when my life unraveled before me, I began seeing what my future could be if I simply asked myself for one. I obliged myself and went from 225 pounds in April to now 178 pounds with 7 more to go. The only reason I have not lost my confidence to continue is because of why i was doing it, and it was for my future. 

This all ties back into self validation. If you can validate your future and ask yourself kindly to give you what you want, you can actually begin a healthy partnership with yourself. Your ends get met, your expectations are more healthy and rounded, and you find pride in accomplishments you never would have before, all because all we ever knew was the shitty person we saw in the mirror. 

But wipe a stained mirror and suddenly you look a lot better. Our perceptions of the 4 walls around us as we lay in bed at night and wonder if we truly exist like others is not the reality that others see nor even the truth of the world. Though this would by no means erase our perceptions over night, it helps to serve us a healthy meal of humility. We can change a lot of how we see things and how we see ourselves. In fact, the only way I have ever changed for the better was by showing myself I could, not others. 

If I wanted to show I had confidence, I did things that inspired confidence rather than try to impress someone. You can see how many might confuse the two. 

I think if you truly want to find out who you are under this thumb of BPD, you have to stop treating yourself like a victim. 

Easier said than done but I have really learned I can capable of doing much more than i qpreviously thought all because I stopped becoming and molding my reality to the disorder. ",BPD

"Relationship Struggles / General Talking Hey Everyone,

First time poster and only started reading a few weeks ago. I've been in a relationship for about 8 months now, and the lust factor wore off I'd say 2-4 months ago. As soon as that collapsed, I've been panicking every since. Some days I'll go by fine and without issue, and other days my mind becomes completely and utterly consumed by the thoughts of the relationship, thoughts of long term, thoughts of breaking up (this one is fucking me up something awful, I'm having two panic attacks almost daily it is the most consuming as well). I like this girl a lot. I love this girl, and when I see through the fucking clouds I can make the connection, but those days are few and far between. It is probably important to note that my job is INCREDIBLY stressful. On call 24/7,  and essentially working every day. I start to feel trapped with everything, and my mind begins to find the only solution is breaking up, and it'll just pound and pound on the topic. Sometimes I'll sit there and just hold my head and want to scream / cry with the thoughts as my girlfriend calmly and patiently talks to and help in anyway that she can. She is the best kind of support anyone could ask, and it is killing me that my mind is making an enemy of her. Some days are better, some are worse. But it seems every day that is the only thought my mind can become consumed with. We are still having sex, we talk incredibly well, she has been attempting CBT treatment with me and it seems to work sometimes. I also started Zoloft today after another panic attack, calling a mental health line and receiving absolutely 0 assistance or positive support. I was prescribed this on Monday by my Family doctor, and I have been incredibly hesitant to take it and my girlfriend is quite against them (however very accepting of me now that I have started), but my brother started them two weeks ago and the way he is explaining it is exactly in line with my struggles and issues, and how it is helping him. 

I can not pinpoint where this is coming from and we are considering couples therapy at the moment. I mean, I really like this girl and I'm willing to try many things before exhausting the relationship. There is something mentally blocking me from truly enjoying myself. My previous relationship I held in EVERY single emotion I had, and repressed everything until I become a neglectful burden who couldn't help himself and ended up getting dumped because of it. I essentially did the exact same thing in this relationship up until maybe 2-3 weeks ago, since then I've been spilling all the guts. I had a couple really bad panic attacks within the last two months that triggered the mindset and I haven't been able to free myself of it since. This is far from the only thing I panic about, existentialism, people dying, feeling of a hopeless future have always been present. However, I don't know how to escape it and was hoping to see if anyone else had gone through similar experience or problems. Feel free to ask away any questions. 

Edit: Also I find the mental health support not to be the best in my area (Hamilton, ON). If anyone has any recommendations on where I can find a therapist or psychiatrist that would be greatly appreciated. I've almost checked myself into a hospital 2 times in the past few weeks, and I can't get immediate help anywhere. I'm using my girlfriend as my therapist essentially because I don't talk to many other people at all and it is just adding significant more stress, frustration and burden to he relationship.",BPD
"Asking boyfriend (46 m) of three years refuses to participate in my therapy. I'm 37f and I've been in DBT treatment for a a year and eight months. I've been on lithium and seroquel for five years. I've been in recovery from alcoholism in AA for three years. 

There has been a vast change in my life in this time. One area I continue to struggle is in my relationship. Sensing or experiencing abandonment and social media attention from women are two areas that set me off and when I say set me off, I experience a trigger that inspires a fear so strong that it releases adrenaline and the fight or flight response with an intensity that doesn't allow me the buffer moment to choose to access my skills. Not even TIPP which is designed for these moments. I fly off the handle and say horrible things and threaten to leave and I just lose all self-control. 

At this point. I'm ready to consider all areas. Possibly it is a medication issue where an upped dosage of my lithium or the addition of some medication used to treat intermittent rage that works to slow that response when triggered. And I am wanting my partner to join me in therapy not because I expect him to walk on eggshells or that he necessarily needs to change anything he is doing. I just feel I could benefit from support in addressing these issues and him to be in on the process I am going through. I feel like I could benefit from him being present at my psychiatrist appointment to weigh in and help me consider pros and cons of medication changes. 

I know that my recovery is my responsibility. And I know I am responsible to recover regardless of who is and isn't in my life. Does it make sense that I am desiring his involvement at this time? Or is it just more BPD clingy nonsense? I don't trust my own perceptions and desires at this point and that is painful. I intuit something such as this, and then immediately second guess it. 

What if he says no? I've mentioned it and he says he has been in therapy with women in the past and all that happens is he is told what to do and the focus is on him. I explained that this isn't therapy for him, but for me, as someone who accepts responsibility for her diagnosis and is seeking solutions, and that he is just there to balance my perspective, learn, and give feedback and support. He is ""thinking about it"" currently. 

What if he tells me he doesn't want to be involved? That's going to hurt. Does this mean I need to rethink my involvement with him if, under the context I've described, he refuses to engage in this with me, after being together this amount of time? 

I have a hard time trusting my perceptions due to knowing BPD drives my bus and things are often distorted.

I went totally numb I just stared at the wall for a brief minute, and then my brother told me as he was laughing that my father told him if I ever did anything wrong he swore on god that he will let go of me as his daughter, I felt humiliated because my brother is 10, I know he's young but still. Why did my father told a 10 year old something like that about his daughter to someone else, that makes him look bad as a father in general. I had a mental breakdown I want to commit suicide so fucking much I am going insane, I am in too much psychological pain that I can barely function.. I had no one to calm me down to the point where I embarrassingly was crying in bed Hysterically with my hand in my head to lie to me brain to feel like I am with someone that is calming me down. 

I have no support,no love.

"How do I stop worrying about the future? So basically the situation that is getting me worried (I know that this is stupid but like dis what bpd does to you) is that I haven't called my friend who is basically my sister that's how close I have thought we are for almost two weeks. Like we usually call almost once a week and she seems a little avoiding of me. I tried to call her but she declined because she's ""eating"" according to her. Ik this is retarded to stress over but I can't help myself 

I can't just distract myself because my worries would still be playing in the back of my head and I would just feel guilty for avoiding my life and feel even worse when my distractions go and I'm forced to face my thoughts

A) calm down my thoughts and stop worrying and replace them with positive thoughts and not give a fuck

I dropped the class but kept in contact under the pretense of a study group. I see now, and there were hints before, that he has some serious feelings for me. He goes out of his way to an extreme point to see me, even after I reschedule for lame excuses.  I say 'friend' because I feel like he just used the study group to hang out and make a connection with me instead of asking me to hang out as a friend (or more). 

This week he wants to take off from the class one day just to see me. It's eating at me. I'm obsessing over it and it's haunting me. I have to admit that I yes I did think he was fun to talk to sometimes but there was no romantic connection at all. Also, he keeps me abreast of the things in my class. Quite juvenilely, I'm worried he will start talking shit about me once I let him down. I don't know what's worse--having to keep him at an arm's length distance and feeling burdened thinking I'm leading him on, or being mostly cut off from everyone and worrying what smack is being said.

but that's all changed. I'm in a relationship with someone I met online and by chance it seems like I finally got it right. its almost like I just have no doubts like I normally have, perhaps because my partner is even more attached to me then I am (not by much very similar levels) .

He wants to work less and will probably take about half a year off on disability before he decides to go back to a new job. He wants to travel and stuff.

my parents have never been able to afford mental health coverage, so i got my own insurance with a plan that specializes in it. my psychiatrist deals with depression, anxiety, bpd, and eating disorders. she has amazing reviews and some of my friends go to her. her office visits are also going to be super cheap with my new plan. 

after struggling for so long and having to go through cycles of self destruction and then recovering and then self destruction again, i'm finally getting the help i need. i'll finally be able to work through everything that has happened to me since my childhood. it's going to be a long and very painful process, i know. but it's going to be worth it. 

i'm so excited to start dbt and this new chapter of my life. i'm so excited to be able to control my bpd a little better than i do in the steps i need to take. i'm so excited to be healthy. it's going to be easier for people to want to be around me, and it's going to be easier for me to want to be around myself. 

i know this isn't asking for advice but i just wanted to put this good energy out somewhere. i'm very nervous for this process and what talking is going to dredge up for me, and the self realization that i have to deal with. but i'm so ready to get better.

"Texting with Your Partner - How Do Normal People Do It? (Rant-ish) I think I just need someone to talk me off a ledge. Been dating this guy for about a month. We both said ""love"" the last time we saw each other (I know I know...too soon). He's about as intense as I am, which is refreshing in some ways and terrifying in others. 

​

He tends to be very hot and cold with texting. Early on, he came on really strong with it, texting me incessantly even before we had our first date (we met on OKC). Sometimes he goes through these dips where he'll sort of respond but if he does, then it's limited and he won't initiate. He's done this a few times only to come back around to incessant texting again. 

​

Now he's doing it again. We said we loved each other last Monday night, and he's been a little distant seeming since then. He did say he was really busy with work and he hasn't been ignoring me completely, and as I write this and put it out there I realize how completely irrational I'm being. I just can't help it. I feel like he hates me - like I scared him away.

I am a miserable broken individual who has no basic ability to function like a human being let alone any coping mechanisms. Texting is the worst ever invention for people with BPD. I hate wondering why he hasn't thought of me or wanted to say anything to me. I feel amped and constantly poised to run. How do people cope with this ?

"Suicidal BPD Sister Advice So as the title says I could do with advice off of you guys. Quick background; sister (24) has a history of extreme behaviour (getting extremely drunk and argumentative for example). For years my mum and I (25) have been trying to deal with it. She got diagnosed with BPD and is waiting to start her therapy and medication.

I am writing this after what was another horrific night. She got drunk, asked for help on something. I offered my help, but she wanted to turn it into an argument with my mum. She never cared about getting help, just wanted to argue and get aggressive. It got worse and worse to the point where she got violent and I had to defend myself. She then ran away, and sent my mother suicidal text messages. Telling her she's at the top of a deadly drop, that she may as well jump, and then said ""fuck it"" and that was the last we heard for hours. This was all in the early hours of the morning.

She will do that regularly, 'play games' so to speak. I don't want to call her evil, and I get that she has this big difficulties. But there is just no justification for these actions. But it seems like it never changes.

She has done this for years... But I always feel like she excuses it because of BPD or what she figured was depression years ago. I am kind of at my end with this. It has been going on for years now, my mum has absolutely no life as it is purely dedicated to her.

Can any of you with BPD or having dealt with family with BPD advise on what to do? Even just the understanding of those who have dealt with it would be amazing. ",BPD

We have been broken up for a few months now, but we were trying to make a friendship work. We were hanging out every week and still talking like friends do. He started seeing a new girl (actually his ex, but new as of recent) but I accepted that. It stung of course, but I truly was glad that he was happy. Last week they made their relationship official on the same day that he and I last hung out. Since then, he has been cold, distant and unresponsive. Finally, today he told me that he doesn't want anything to do with me anymore because I'm too toxic to him in his life right now. 

I'm so hurt and confused. We were great friends a week ago, but now I'm nothing. We have both changed a lot in the past few months, definitely enough to maintain a healthy friendship. So to me it feels like he just doesn't care enough about me to try. Ultimately it doesn't matter though. He's done with me and damn it hurts. I just got over him romantically. I got to the point where I couldn't even imagine being with him romantically or sexually and that was such a big win for me. But having all contact and relationship with him stripped away so seemingly suddenly brings all that pain back. I feel the BPD monster swelling inside of me. I feel the desperation, the emptiness. That feeling that I am worthless, justifying all the reasons he would possibly want me so completely out of his life.

"Moved Out of Me & FPs Apartment Yesterday Yesterday was finally the day I moved out of the apartment I shared with my ex/FP.  I have a lot of conflicting emotions about it.  We broke up back in August, but he really wanted to continue living there so he could be there for me and help me since I was in a pretty dark place at the time (which had actually led to the breakup).  I had hope that we could maybe work things out and reconcile, but he was adamant that he only wanted to be friends which I just could not accept.  The last few months have been a nightmare of BPD: doing literally anything for his attention, multiple suicide attempts and subsequent inpatient stays, police involvement, constant screaming and crying...you know the deal. 

I knew that the living situation was toxic for both of us (and our 2 other roommates), he knew it was, our friends and family, my therapists all told me it was and obviously moving out was going to be the best thing for me to do.  But I knew once I left that whatever control I had over his life would be gone, I felt I would be admitting our relationship was over and I fought tooth and nail to stay.  I made both of us absolutely miserable and it really became a massive roadblock in terms of my therapy and progress.  I was obsessed with his comings and goings, who he was with, paranoid he was seeing other girls.

Finally everyone in the apartment had enough and my roommates threatened me with a restraining order and eviction in the middle of October.  I searched nonstop for a place I could afford, at the time I was not working, and wasn't having much luck.  Things kept getting more and more tense and I felt trapped and hopeless.  I was given permission to stay for the month of November since it looked like I wouldn't be able to find a place in time.

The thought of how awful another month in the apartment would be drove me to yet another suicide attempt and hospitalization.  While I was in there, I got some incredible news: first, I got hired for what was basically my dream job at a tech startup and second, that my first choice apartment I had looked at decided they wanted me to take the room.  Within a week I had gone from being section 12'd to coming home, packing up my entire life and starting a new job.  Very stressful.

My ex/FP was really great the last week, he spent nearly every night with me trying to enjoy our remaining time together.  He helped me do all the heavy lifting from our 4th floor apartment and drove the uHaul to the new place.  He was really amazing in checking in with how I was doing because he knew how hard this was for me and told me how sorry he was for everything that had happened and how he wished things could have been different but he knew this was the best thing for me.  He told me how hard this was for him too, even if he didn't show it as dramatically, that he wouldn't be throwing a party to celebrate me being gone because he loved me and would miss me a lot.

I woke up this morning in a strange house and suddenly everything sunk in.  I miss him so much, I miss our home, I miss our kitchen and bathroom and my old bedroom.   I'm trying not to contact him at all and give us both some space and time to relax.  I feel very lonely because I don't know my roommates at all and I have a hard time getting to know new people.  I'm angry because I feel like his life goes on as normal and mine got turned upside down.  I really hate and resist change of any kind, very set in my ways (even if they are harmful and self destructive).  I'm trying to remind myself that adjusting to all this is going to take some time and that's perfectly normal.  That I have a lot of opportunity ahead of me, my own place, my freedom.  The ability to find myself again, make some real honest to goodness friends, and figure out my passions, hobbies, identity to eventually be happy again.  I can see some light at the end of the tunnel, I just have to push myself to keep going and not give up.

"Advice on how to help BPD husband through incredibly stressful time while trying to prevent him from destroying our life again? Hey all and TIA for reading, I'll try to keep it as short as possible. I've been married 12 years, we're in our early 30's. My husband is a loving and wonderful man who also has BPD. I have seen it all over the years, he struggled with substance abuse and suicidal thoughts and actions for years until he was properly diagnosed and started a treatment plan about 4 years ago. With his substance abuse came cheating, compulsive gambling, inability to hold a job, constant lying of course and emotional, verbal and even physical abuse. Also all of this came along with this attitude toward me where I cannot possibly say or do anything right. He saw me as a total piece of human garbage because (in my opinion) this made him feel justified in whatever behaviors he wanted to indulge in that are harmful to me or our marriage. Whether I was yelling and crying or softly whispering and encouraging it didn't matter, I was the enemy. He saw what he wanted to see and he abandoned me emotionally 100%. As soon as I moved out he's in the hospital due to overdose, that happened twice in a year (2012). I felt like I was living in literal Hell for years and when the abuse became especially physical one day and I left and it ended in his second suicide attempt I remained moved out until he was being properly treated and staying on his meds consistently etc. Anyway for the last few years things have been remarkably better. He's stayed on his meds properly, stuck with counseling and made other positive changes like learning to open up to me which has been HUGE. Of course he's not perfect, nobody is, but he is HAPPY, or as least as happy as any of us. He doesn't ever want to hurt himself or me in any way. He feels shocked that he ever lived that way. The substance abuse, gambling, cheating, and physical abuse have not been an issue. He has gotten and kept a very good job (the first one he has ever managed to get, honestly, where I am not the breadwinner by a large margin). His doctor calls him his success story and until recently I have wholeheartedly agreed. We have come a million miles in terms of quality of life and quality of our relationship. It has been a lot of really hard work and slow progress but definitely worth it. It's been so awesome to see him so healthy and happy. We still have our roller coasters with his moods at times but normally I can handle it with some compassion and detachment. I have been SO PROUD of him, like I cannot say that or scream that loud enough. He has tried so many different medicines that have scary side effects, he's made himself vulnerable beyond what I would probably be capable of, he's overcome addictions many people struggle with their whole lives, I mean he has WORKED to become the man he is today. Which is the man he has always been, really. The one I've always known he was, or could be. Anyhow recently his mother was diagnosed with cancer and things don't look good. Understandably he is incredibly stressed out and my heart breaks for him, truly. At the same time I am concerned about his bad behaviors all being triggered and myself being in a situation where I have to choose between supporting him in this hard time and protecting myself. Already I've seen lottery tickets in the trash, he called in to work one day last week simply because he didn't feel like going, there's porn on the computer history (always starts that way, ""normally"" I wouldn't really freak about porn but with him it always escalates to dating sites and then actual cheating), and he's lashing out at me over the smallest of things. For example he berated me for an hour last night about how I am always unhappy and miserable and he can't take it anymore and doesn't know what to do. (This is not true. Side note, I try SO hard, always, to be positive. Literally anyone who knows me except my husband would tell you I'm a very positive, happy person. And he would tell you that when he is ""himself"" as well. It's my nature. My grandmother died the day after Thanksgiving and yes, excuse me so much, I have been a tad depressed. But this is the type of perspective toward me that I was talking about earlier.) All because I said I didn't like Nesquick, which was the only type of chocolate milk our local store carries. It's too chocolatey. Literally that's all I said. But anyway, you get the idea. All the red flags popping up, all the old things starting anew. He's also been blowing money on God knows what and he was very cold and unfeeling toward me during my grandma's illness/death/services and so I do kind of feel like that's emotional abuse cropping up. My grandma and I were close, I loved her very much and my husband's treatment of me during this time was surreal and I haven't felt truly, 100% connected to him since. His personality has just changed, gone cold, and his bad habits seem to be back too. Approaching him about any of it, no matter how gently, results in a huge fight where he seems incapable of seeing that I am trying to prevent a downward spiral here. That old game. So already we're back to not communicating and me being the scum, so quickly after years of progress. It's overwhelming for me. Everything in our life is once again slipping through my fingers like it never got better at all, like I imagined the last few years. Once again I feel helpless and I feel like I have to passively just watch him regress and ruin our life in order to avoid a full fledged, unwinnable war and I'm already feeling resentful. I feel like I have two husbands, a good one and a bad one. Most of the time I live with the good one but sometimes the bad one takes over. The bad one has been ""in check"" for a number of years but it looks like he's making a comeback and honestly I don't think I can go down this road again. Let alone every time something really bad happens in life. I see now that I have been really, ridiculously naive. At the same time, I simply cannot abandon him. I love him very much and I know he is ill and has a very difficult situation on his heart. When I suggest he speak to his psychiatrist about what's going on he basically ignores me completely and his appointments are like 10 minutes long. I feel terrible saying this but I only have so much compassion. I know I won't be able to tag along this hell ride again if it goes too far. But who is supposed to help and support you if not your wife?! Also I am afraid if he pushes me to the point of leaving him now when his mother is (likely) dying, he will hurt himself, and that comes with so many emotions I don't even know where to start. So what in the absolute f--- am I supposed to do? For any of you who have BPD, if you were my husband, what would you ideally want me to do for you? What would help you to cope? Any ideas from anyone, BPD sufferers or loved ones, on how I can proceed? I don't even know how to word how scared and paralyzed I feel. I'm at a complete loss. 


tldr; BPD husband who has had symptoms in check for years now going ape due to mother's cancer diagnosis, unsure how to help him or if I am mentally even capable at this point. ",BPD
"DAE Get Overly Sad About Animals Dying? yesterday I was driving home when the cars in front of me started braking and moving over. at first i saw what i thought was roadkill, but the little guy was still alive; a groundhog helplessly flailing in the middle of the road. I just started crying. i felt bad we were all just driving around the little dude, albeit i didn't know to do.

so I called animal control and got no answer. i called the non emergency police number and requested an officer to do something (not unusual around here). the dispatcher sounded a bit baffled about my call, which in turn triggered me and i felt very dumb, but i didn't feel right not doing anything. i figured someone could at least put him out of his misery, or remove him if he had expired before then. 

this morning i drove back down the road, and there he was. dead now (may he RIP), but still laying where he was last night. I broke down again, partly angry no one had even checked on the situation or removed him from the road, and sad to know he likely just laid there suffering or got hit again.

I know i'm being incredibly over emotional about a half-dead groundhog i encountered, but it just made me so sad and guilty i couldn't or didn't ""do more"". i keep picturing him scrambling to get away in my side-view mirror. does anyone else get irrationally upset or empathetic over random animals passing/roadkill? i normally have a brief moment of sadness when i see roadkill, but seeing one that was injured and helpless just really got to me.

"Extreme anger toward other people Whenever I don't like someone, I HATE them. Like pray for their death hate. I hold grudges big time. 

Just a few minutes I noticed two of my ""best"" friends still follow a girl that made my life a living hell two years ago. I am so triggered.  I feel like calling my two friends and screaming at them. I literally had to turn my phone off so I wouldn't do it.

"Adoption and BPD I was adopted when I was 1 from South Korea. My adoptive parents are white. I have no idea who my family is in Asia. 

Since I was little I feel like I fit in no where. Can't relate to other Asians but too Asian to fit in with Caucasians.

I feel abandoned by my birth mother but I get why she did it. And I feel guilty to trying and look for her as my adoptive parents are supportive and have taken care of me.

"Absolutely confused (semi long post) I went to my VA appointment to see my psychiatrist today. Told her all the details about recent events spanning from late July of this year to now.

Since my diagnosis in February of this year, she tells me that going to school or work is a terrible idea as of now because I need to become ""stable"" again.  As of now, I'm told to literally do nothing except stay home (and care for my son). I have aspirations to continue college but every time I mention the idea, it's struck down. Any time I feel the need to pursue my goals I'm told it's ""not time to"".

I also have depression, anxiety and cPTSD. On today's visit, I also asked her about the idea of an ESA or service dog. Her response was along the lines of ""we don't issue such paperwork for problems like this.""

Am I asking the wrong person for advice here or do I just have an awful psychiatrist? I swear, every visit deflates me and makes me loathe the VA more...",BPD
"Am I just easily forgettable? This could be on a deeper level, but what's on my mind is last night. I had dinner with a friend and she had others over. Someone there said multiple times about how it was nice to meet me, but I had been at a party at her house for Halloween in 2015. And had her added on Facebook for some time. Am I forgettable? Do I just remember every single person I meet? People have done this even after hanging out with me multiple times.. it just feels like shit. I remember them but they.. never know who I am. And I don't correct them on it because it's just. Fucking awkward. And then through the rest of the night I just stayed silent like the fucking socially inept person I am. I hate going out. ",BPD
"Seeking advice - deal breaker for a 5+ year relationship? (long post warning) I'd appreciate someone else's point of view on a current relationship issue as I'm not sure I'm capable of making good decisions right now (I feel pretty calm but it's likely tiredness and disassociation). I prefer not to give too much personal detail online, but for some context, I come from a very odd/toxic family dynamic which resulted in me being fairly estranged from my half-siblings. What little time we did spend together as kids was rife with emotional outbursts by yours truly. Around 6 months ago I had an opportunity to reconnect with them and start re-building relationships with them as adults. My sister mentioned she might be in my area sometime in the spring (we live very far from one another, which has always been a contributing factor in the estrangement) but I hadn't heard anything more about the potential trip in months. 

A few days ago I get a text from her saying that she's driving and will be in my area probably later that night. It's short notice, but I'm thrilled. I immediately invite her to crash with me while she's in town. I didn't even think to ask my SO first. After I sent the invite I texted the SO at work with the update. SO was *not* happy. SO was very annoyed by the short notice and at the prospect of company because SO had to work in the morning and we don't have a lot of private space. Later, after SO calmed down I explained how I didn't have a lot of notice myself but given sis's current travel plans I wanted to make sure she had safe accommodations. SO chilled out a bit and offered to pay for a hotel room. It didn't really matter that night because sis didn't end up getting in (got lost on the road). Sis and I made arrangements to hang out the next day. Fast forward to the next afternoon, SO gets home from work grumpy and hungry. Shortly after, my sister arrives. I called SO out of the kitchen for a brief introduction (first time they've ever met) then sis and I go out for a bit and SO stays home. SO knows we're just going out for a little while and then will come back by the house before going to dinner. SO knows how much rebuilding this relationship means to me. I had also voiced on numerous occasions in the past how much it would mean to me for SO to meet this side of my family. When sis and I get back SO is half asleep on the couch. SO says hi but when I ask SO about dinner, SO says ""are you serious?"" It's about 8pm at that point, so it's not terribly late. SO had worked ""3 long days"" in a row (8 hour shifts of mentally/physically exhausting work) and had already eaten. I said ""fine,"" ignore my feelings, and go to dinner with my sister and have a good time with her. Sis refused to let us get her a hotel (I think the offer made her feel uncomfortable), but she did let me hook her up with a couch to sleep on that didn't directly interfere with SO's space. By the time  I got into bed I realized just how...""upset"" isn't even the right word...something along the lines of ""disappointed"" times a million... at how inhospitable my SO had been toward my sister. I asked SO how long SO was going to be up so we could arrange our own sleeping arrangements in separate spaces from one another that night (not a great way to address it, I know). SO thought I was being completely unreasonable and that it was ridiculous to expect SO to come along to dinner when SO was tired and had eaten. SO started claiming that I gave SO reason to think there would be more opportunities to hang out (I had hoped out loud that sis would be in town a couple days, but I know I hadn't claimed that to would be the case because even sis wasn't sure of her plans at that point). Sis was taking off early in the morning and SO got annoyed I hadn't ""even"" suggested breakfast. SO started putting the blame on me for giving SO no warning, going on about how I was being unreasonable, and saying ""you're always making me out to be the bad guy."" 

This wouldn't be the first time that SO has flaked on something, but this particular event was a HUGE deal for me. Chances to see most of my family are very rare and I have been very vocal about how much it would mean to me for SO to meet some of them - my siblings in particular. I feel like this is something I wont be able to get past, ever. I still love SO and a big part of me just wants to go back to how things were, but I feel like this is a sign that we don't share the same values. It make me worry that SO wont be there for me for other important occasions if SO finds it inconvenient. I've had my doubts about the relationship before, but SO has stuck with me through my whole BPD diagnosis and moving toward recovery along with a few personal blunders, so in the past I put the doubts down to my own general relationship-management problems. 

I feel lost. Is SO right? Am I overreacting because of the BPD? Am I expecting too much? Or am I right to feel like this crossed a line? 

Anyway, thanks for reading. Sorry if I'm a bit whiny or incoherent at the moment, but I view r/bpd as an excellent support group full of people who actually understand the inner turmoil and how much an outside point of view can help me gain perspective.

"How in the world did you find a good therapist? Hi all,

I have BPD with the Chameleon effect, along with social anxiety disorder and several behavioral addictions which makes me unresponsive to most traditional forms of therapy. 

I'm finding it really difficult to find a skilled therapist that accepts my insurance.

Most therapists want to throw CBT at me - and DBT therapists are difficult to find. 

Is there a resource that lists the top Borderline Psychologists in each area? I feel like most therapists just don't understand this disease.. and I feel frustrated with wasting time and money on ineffective forms of treatment. 

I wish I lived in CA so I could see Dr Ramini. She really knows bpd inside out. ",BPD
"Exploiting BPD for laughs I'm so confused by every damn meme account on Instagram uploading memes relating to BPD struggles, mainly intense jealousy and mood swings/depression. 

I mean, obviously I can relate myself because these are things I have to live with, but I think it's so weird when seemingly mainstream accounts on social media kind of use these issues to be funny. 

It also makes me wonder if I'm even mentally ill at all, since so many people seem to relate to these things in a ""Fun"" way?",BPD
"I don't know how else to say it, I physically cannot care about myself I could type forever so I'll try not to

I'm mid 30s physically and in many ways 10 mentally.  There is an infinite gap between my knowledge and my drive to apply it.  To oversimplify, I know many things I should and could be doing financially, emotionally and health wise for improvement, and ultimately I don't care.

I spent most of my life from 13 misdiagnosed with bipolar, ran the gambit of medicine with multiple hospital visits for suicide attempts from 14 through 26.  There are many attempts since but no one knows.  I have has ADHD since then but few doctors try to deal with it, now hard to get Adderall or Ritalin because fear of anger. 

When I was 17 life was decent, some friends, healthy bodybuilder who worked at the gym after school.  Then one day I could not find my face cleaner that was moved by the cleaner and got so angry in the shower I punched the glass and severed a bunch of stuff in my wrist and nearly died.  9 months of therapy.  I flinch when I think about it and never was as motivated again. 

Never had a relationship or sex until 30, the few dates I had I was used for free food and liquor.  Being a nice honest person is the last thing girls want is what my experiences taught me.  

A friend of a friend wanted a virgin, we met a few times before.  She took it and it was a good time in other ways so I pursued.  It's easier to be confident when another person accepts you or shows interest in you, which never happened before.

Long story short, we fell in love and eventually moved together a year later with her 6 year old daughter.  Lived together about a year and a half.  There were ups and downs, but I think better than average and we were happy.

Then one day we woke up and I don't even remember what we were talking about.  All of a sudden I became psychotic and screamed at them to leave.  I verbally abused both very badly and grabbed her at one point to make her leave.  Some of it I filmed and I heard my father's voice come out of my mouth and it shocked me.  I lost my ignorance to how bad I really was.  I never contacted her before the restraining order, which made everything worse because she lost the case and never got all their belongings which are gone forever.  It's all my fault and I have no idea why I got so angry and was so selfish after.  Never spoken, I'm too scared to over the apology and reimbursement deserved because I'm worried it too selfish. 

These anger outbursts continue to this day.  IED 
in nature.  It's only been a few years since BPD diagnosis, but my luck with doctors isn't there and I'm pretty much over it.  There's too much emotional neglect in life from all sides.  I love my mom and would be dead without her, but I wish I could go back in time and prevent my father from ever meeting her so her adult life could have had a better chance.



I can read everything I typed above and know exactly what elements are not true in reality and how my even typing this is a sign of caring.  It doesn't matter.  There is a complete disconnect from my good knowledge of what to do with myself and life and my drive to put effort.  It's beyond lazy, I can't care.  I don't remember the last time I brushed my teeth, shower once a week.  I want to go to sleep and not wake up.

I've been suicidal most of my life, and I know in reality that only something like a cyanide capsule would cause me success, I don't want more pain.  I'm not in need of a hospital stay. 

But since the break up I've lost all ability to care.  It's not like I do literally nothing, but close.  I don't know how to care, there's nothing there anymore.  It's beyond fear and laziness, I look at it as chemical.

I know logically how much of my words are objectively untrue.  And I know better than many people most of what to do to be healthy and financially successful.  I can't care.  Knowledge or intelligence is completely useless with no way to apply it.

I thank you very if you made it through that",BPD
"Afraid I've missed my shot with a great guy, falling into old patterns I've never posted here before. I'm 24, diagnosed with BPD since high school. 

About two months ago I started talking to this amazing guy online, who I met up with not long after. Let's call him Gary. We've been hanging out a lot, talking almost every day since. He's the coolest, we have all kinds of deep conversations, he has a thousand stories to tell, and I really feel like we click. The only thing is...neither of us has ever actually made a move on the other. I come over, we chill, we talk, and I leave. That was fine for a while! I don't mind talking things slow and building a friendship first. It's probably healthier for me to play things like that anyway. 

About a week ago I started to get anxiety about the situation. ""I really like him, and it SEEMS like he's really into me too, why hasn't anything progressed?"" I told myself that he's weird in his own way (which is true) and that he probably just was not the type to initiate stuff like that. I know he has issues with people touching him too, so of course I respect that and haven't tried to do anything. I tell myself that the next time I come visit I'll sit down and have a frank conversation about what we're doing here. 

I get the chance yesterday. He's moving, so I drove over to help him drive some things to his new place. As we're on our way back, he gets a text and tells me that his friend is gonna be stopping by to hang for a while. I ask who this guy is, and Gary tells me this guy is someone he's been hanging with for a few weeks now, and it comes out that Gary had this guy over a few days before, and they had sex. He told me that he didn't expect it but the guy was really aggressive and Gary actually really liked that. 

I'm devastated. I'm in the car with this guy I'm falling for, who made a big deal out of how he moves slow and doesn't like to be touched, and he's talking about how the first skinny guy to look at him just came and had his way with him. I'm trying to hold back tears. He realizes that I'm NOT okay, and starts changing the subject and trying to talk to me and I could barely say a word or look at him. We get back to the house and of course the guy is hot as fuck. We go in and ate our food while the guy is clearly flirting with Gary and trying to show me up. I plan to leave but then the guy says he has to go before I get a chance. It's just me and Gary now, but now I can't work up the nerve to talk about my feelings or what just happened. Gary doesn't even try to bring it up either even though I'm clearly upset. On my way home I texted him ""I'm sorry I got so weird, thanks for everything today."" I hoped to get him to ask about it. He just responded with ""That's alright, I appreciate the help!""

I don't know what to do. I've been in similar situations too many times. I feel like I need to sit him down and be frank about my feelings and ask him upfront what he feels about me. But at the same time, it feels like it's too late. If he thinks its cool to talk to me about the guys he hooks up with, is that not a clear signal that he sees me as a friend? I'm terrified of looking like a fool AGAIN. I'm terrified of hearing ""just friends"" AGAIN. I'm terrified of pining after a guy who barely sees me, AGAIN. But I'm also terrified of AGAIN, missing a chance because I'm too afraid of rejection. I'm at a very low point right now and just, could really use any advice or even just some affirmation that this sucks.",BPD

I can't help feeling like she's moved on completely, she's found someone new and is moving in together and I'm just a guy she used to know. Then again she could be moving back home to help with her parents. She told me her brother died not long after I left.

Sigh. I just don't know what to do about her anymore. I made it a point to try and forget her but I cant. Admittedly, I love her still. She was my best friend, I have had feelings for her as long as I can remember.

I can't let go. I made it a point to avoid talking to her. I ignored her texts, then got a new number, after that she never reached out. I felt it best to keep my distance. I wanted to get better. Maybe get a handle on my problems before I contacted to her. It's hard for me to let her go and I don't know how. 

I tried to move on. I went on some dates, got new friends. Got a full time job. I am just emotionally tethered to her and I don't know how to break it. I want to continue a friendship with her, but if I can't see past the relationship failure of ours. I can't get past the pain.

Any advice? ",BPD
"I'm not sure if I have Bpd, but I want to know if my anxiety has damaged my relationship with my ex step mom? ( Long post ) I am 18 years old, she is 50, and dads been married to her for 4 years, divorced back in January. We have been in touch ever since mutually so it's not me initiating all the contact or anything. My issue is my anxiety disorder, and because of that I've always told her that she didn't HAVE to be in my life, and if she preferred to just move on that I understood and I admit I've asked her that A LOT. Not that I would want that to happen, but I'd just rather be prepared emotionally. She knows of the anxiety I have and has been very patient with me and even told me to always call her if I was having another anxiety moment. Again I admit that I've over done it, not on purpose though.


 Back on Saturday I called her while she was driving to Texas ( didn't know she was on the road on that particular day  )  and we talked and this is what I said "". Hey, I just wanted to say I know you're not my biological mom, but I love you as if you were, and I just wanted to know if that was mutual, but if not thats fine. "" I've told her that before by the way, Her response was "" Hon, I appreciate that, but you need to stop worrying about our ( me and her ) relationship, I keep telling you this remember? Remember I told you that I know how you feel about me, and if I didn't feel the same I wouldn't have interacted with you like I did when we first met. I keep telling you, you do not have to worry about our relationship. If I felt that I wanted to cut contact or walk away, I would have done that after the divorce, you need to stop worrying about this. I treat you the same as my daughter . I'm a person of my word and I promised you that I wasn't going anywhere remember? ( Not that I asked her to promise anything ) I told you that I'm always here for you right and that youre stuck with me right? Maybe you need to talk to your dad about this. "" She wasn't mad, but sounded slightly irritated.






She then asked "" What are your plans for today ""? I told her I actual had an appointment with my therapist. She said "" Ok, you really need to talk to him about this, because I don't know what else to tell you. "" She couldn't talk for too long, but before she had to go she said "" Like always, just tell me how it goes, ok? "" 

So when I got back from my therapist, she texted me a picture of her and her dog ( that she always refers to as my older brother ) both lying in bed resting. I replied laughing, and said "" Both of your heads look huge, I talked to my therapist about my anxiety with you, ( I've had this with others to ) and he's given me some good insight. Me and him are going to continue  working on this during future sessions. I hope this isn't wrecking our relationship. Her response was "" I worry about you, but I'm still here to help see you through this, but as I said before, you have to want to make that change. ""  I told her that I was and thanked her for recommending me to talking with my therapist about this and that it was slowly starting to help. ( I thought so ) Her response was, good I'm glad. 









Later, I started to have another anxiety moment because I thought I may have made a mistake, and went to far in what I said to her. In my mind I thought I harassed her which was ridiculous because she called 3 days before that saying hi, but my anxiety can convince me of anything. So I went downstairs and told my dad  "" I think I may have screwed up "" and told him everything. Now because of my anxiety, I probably unintentionally made everything seem worse than it really was, because that's what I thought. Anyway my dad said "" How many times has she invited you for lunch, over for dinner, or when you went with her and her daughter to bowling, and there cookout? You don't take her word for that? You don't think that maybe the reason why she's in touch with you is because she actually wants to? And she told me more than once that you were like a son to her, we were still together at that moment but still "" I never knew she said that, but I do remember after the divorce, she told me that I am a great son to her, that she saw me as one of her own  and she did say "" love you "" once when saying goodnight over text, but I'm not sure if she still sees things that way or not.





 I guess with me is that, I have a hard time believing that someone besides my father could care about me, especially when they don't have to. The other part is, I've been hurt before a few times, not with a situation like this of course, but I'm used to things not being mutual. So I guess in this situation where someone wants to be in my life as I do there's, I just, it's new to me. It always seemed like anytime something good happened, there was always a bad side to it that would smack me in the face, so I'm always on "" red alert "" expecting the worst. 










I got a text from her that next day saying "" I'm in the Bahamas now ( family trip ), and I replied by saying "" Good glad you guys made it safe, have fun. I just wanted you to know I'm serious about this, you have my word that I'm going to really work on my anxiety issues, I promise. She replied "" Great, I'm glad "" I said "" Take care. "" Now according to my dad, he did text her earlier that morning because he wanted to get some understanding and clarity of what happened.  She called him back before she got on the flight, I guess he told her everything I said, and from his words she said this "" No nothing he said made me uncomfortable at all! I think the world of him, but see, he keeps asking me about, if I'm going to be cutting contact with him, and I keeping telling him, I'm always going to be in his life, but he doesn't seem to get that, so it confuses me and throws me off "". So my dad told me to just trust her.

Later on that day I got a text from her saying "" I just wanted to let you know, I think you need to take sometime, and focus on yourself, and when you're better, or when you're making progress, then you should touch base with me ""  I responded by saying "" yes I understand "".










I'm not sure if this relationship is damaged or not. I'm not sure if that's her way of cutting contact, fading out, or if she just wants to give me space to properly get better without any distractions, or maybe she's angry? I see my therapist once a week, and I definitely have work to do. I guess maybe I'll touch base during the beginning of next month maybe. Yesterday I got an accidental text from her but she apologized saying she meant to send that to a relative.

I asked my dad again "" when you guys spoke, did she say she needed space ""? He said "" not at all man, that wasn't even what the conversation was about, she was just frustrated because you weren't seeming to understand her telling you that she's always going to be in your life "".

So what are your thoughts guys?

"I failed Trig. Again. This was my second time taking the class. I knew as soon as I started making good grades in there that I was going to fuck it up, somehow. And I did. 

I'm going to fail my Japanese II class as well. Which brings my GPA low enough to move from Academic Probation to Suspension. 

I've started the process of appealing to the school so I don't have to stay out for a semester. Because I know if I go home I won't come back. 

I worked so hard to get here and I keep fucking it up. I don't want to fail again. I feel like such a loser. I want to quit sabotaging myself. ",BPD
"Struggling with Time and Space, specifically in reference to a personal relationship Context:



This is coming to mind because of a former FP/girlfriend who I tend to miss in waves. When it hits, it hits, but I always remember what happened, why we don't speak anymore, and then the feeling fades. We were very similar people, and she may have been struggling with the same form of quiet BPD as well.


However, this feels much deeper than just missing someone. I am fixated on the idea that our separation is forever only temporary. For example: we stopped talking for about 2 years, post-breakup. Zero communication, zero contact. I planted my feet elsewhere and was able to find new friends, objectives, etc. The one thing I can tell you was that I still felt no aspect of permanence - No matter what, the absence was only temporary, in my mind. The problem is - I was proven correct.



We DID in fact start a friendship again, completely naturally, and started texting, communicating again. Hell, we even hung out for a pretty lengthy duration of time earlier this year. Nothing sexual, but we never forgot who each other were, and the quirks and aspects of each others' personalities. When that part of it actually manifested through tension, it became clear we had to part ways again. It stings, but immediately afterwards I began thinking of how and when we would organically fall back into contact again. 



With the Context in mind: 



I presently feel stuck in this loop. I don't feel like a helpless human being, but I do feel that I am destined to forever question this specific relationship, and anticipate the next time it will exist in my life, because I convince myself that it will. Again, I feel like she is a very similar person, and it explains why our relationship has taken this trajectory, but I know for a fact she has seen other people since, and even since this most recent time as well. We never spend time together, but I still feel like I know her. There is ZERO evidence to support my thinking, and even typing this right now, I understand how selfish this is. It's just something I can't control.



Further, I know I don't live in a loop, physically, but emotionally, I feel like I am on this ride for life. I fell for a girl after her, and we had a brief but wild fling, but as much as I still think about that particular time, I knew it was fleeting; a product of College and uncertainty. Love is love, and the first time hit the hardest. I thought I felt it a second time, and maybe I did. Only the heart knows.



But here I am, waiting for a sign that this loop is not permanent. I miss my friend, I miss talking and discussing similarities, and I even miss when she told me I was flat out wrong. It's all so far removed from my Present, but I can't convince myself it's done forever. My self won't let me.



Thanks for being here, Reddit. My thoughts go out to anyone feeling even remotely similar, or alone.",BPD
"Relapse. I was doing so well.

I felt in control. I felt normal.

I had a panic attack over the weekend. A vivid memory of my ex threatening to slice my throat and then slice his, so ""we would always be together"".

It just went downhill from there.

I go from depressed to happy to angry in a heartbeat. It's exhausting. I'm so tired. It's been 6 days of trying to grab on to the edge so I don't fall deeper. And people have been trying to help. My partner of 8 years is almost immune to my mood swings a majority of the time. But recently, as he is working on his thesis project, he has become all too stressed to handle me in addition to his deadlines. And I understand. I get it.

Queue up the feelings of impending abandonment now.

My way of reassuring that I am not abandoned is to get mad first. Outwardly mad. Vindictive. Unapologetic. Cruel. It's like I become a new person. It's like I'm watching this person from behind, unable to contribute to the conversation, or get them to stop. But the thought process is, if I make the first strike, they have to yield, and then I'm in control of the situation. And it would be my decision to end the relationship. That's how I managed to emerge from high school, almost 10 years ago, with no friends. No one. Nothing. I ""didn't want them"".

But this? My relationship with this caring, thoughtful, benevolent human being? I want this.

And it scares the shit out of me that I might do something to jeopardize literally everything.

I have Medicare though the state. But trying to find a shrink that I can actually trust is just as difficult as trying to maintain a current relationship. My last shrink was constantly canceling appointments, and then went on vacation for three months. I was offered a substitute in her absence, but of course I refused. It wouldn't be the same. I would have to start from scratch. Whoever I got wouldn't know the intrinsic functions of my disorder. What the hell? How could she do this to me? How could she just leave me to figure out my own shit?

Of course, I still thought all of this, knowing that she had a colon cancer scare (cancelled appointments for screenings) and then became pregnant shortly after (three months ""vacation"").

My partner is urging me to go to my college of attendance and see an on-site therapist provided by the school. It would be free. But I am afraid they will deem me unfit to function on a daily basis without supervision. I'm not suicidal persay, it's more of ""hey if I jumped off the parking structure, this would be over pretty quick, nice to know there's an out"".

I just don't know what to do anymore. This is the worst relapse I've had in a few years. I don't want to fight this battle anymore, but it seems I don't have a choice.

I've gotten better at tracking my thought process. It's the slamming on the brake pedal before I run into troubling social situations that is impossible as of now.",BPD
"It's ridiculous how easily can my FP motivate me i just realized how much having an FP could help me through my depressive episodes, i kinda was totally isolated and alone since some months but now i have a new favorite person and that's good for me. i mean yes, ofc jealousy sometimes tearing me apart and those moments when i'm thinking about ""what's the matter why she didn't write more? i know.. she thinks i'm boring and annoying"" and etc etc BUT looking my life objectively, havin jealousy problems is way better than killing myself because of my loneliness. i mean sometimes i feel the opposite but now i'm feelin okay and i want to live because of my fp. 

and moreover i started learn german because my fp moved to germany so yea i gotta learn it i guess because why not and i realized that it's so scary and so awesome that someone could motivate me this much without saying anything. 

i know this post is just a nonsense and probably you gonna downvote it but whatever i just wanted to share that i'm kinda happy now but i can't tell anyone this because they would think i'm a weirdo.

"BPDers, help me understand what happened? I was with my ex uBPD for 6 years.  This last summer, she started to split on me.  One night she came to the house and went out of her mind.   She was just dying to have a fight.  Did every trick in the book to trigger me and get me to react.  Every provocation she could come up with.  I totally kept my cool.  She got to the point where she stared pulling things off the wall and smashing them.  I locked myself in a bedroom and she bashed on the door, about to break it.  Then went outside the house and bashed the bedroom windows.  It was scary.  

I finally let her into the room and she got on the bed l, curled up in a ball, and said: ""please break up with me because I can't do it!!""

I told her I didn't want to break up with her. I wanted to have a healthy relationship. 

Later that night she started head banging and I think gave herself a concussion.  

The next day I was loving and understanding and wanted to work through things.  

From that point she stated to recede.  Got cold and distant.  It was super painful.  She eventually just called me one morning and said, very coldly, that she needed 3 to 6 months of no contact.  Then, the very next day she texted me: ""Happy Birthday!!""   It felt super cruel.  I hadn't slept for 24 hours and it felt like she was twisting the knife.  Then, a week later, she emailed me about some concert tickets I had bought her.  I didn't respond to either email.  

From a non BPD perspective, I think she was trying to provoke a reaction from me - and had for a while - in order for her to claim victim status.  

I don't know. I'm just crushed.  And so confused.  I was a good man to her and tried so hard.  It's irrelevant but I wonder if she was lining up someone new.  And wanted 3 to 6 months to see if she would be better off without me. ",BPD

She has other stuff on there about the relationship between childhood abandonment and Outer Child, etc. A lot of it just sounds like BPD by another name, and I tend to dismiss stuff like this as ""pseudopsychology mumbo jumbo,"" but I related a little too hard to a lot of what I read on there.

"How to keep yourself in check? Recently got diagnosed with BPD.

"Guys, I acted like a grown up today... it was really fucking odd lol Big family drama explosion earlier while I was at work. Started to lose it (sobbing uncontrollably) but I used my DBT skills (I'm only doing it solo right now) and reigned myself in.

(Normally I would lie to save face, though admitting that sucks) And I didn't spiral. And I didn't sink into a pit of self-destructive despair.

"Seeking Relationship Advice (Wife has BPD) Alright, so i'm new to this page and as my title suggests i'm looking for advice on my relationship with my wife. I read the side bar so I feel that I should mention that my wife has been officially diagnosed and i'm not just coming here cause I think she has BPD.

So, we have been married for going on 5 years now and it has been one hell of a roller coaster. What dosen't help our relationship is that on top of her BPD I have Aspergers, which, after some reading, I've come to discover is a match made in insanity. 
Our ability to communicate effectively has degraded over the years and last night I realized how bad its gotten. A screaming match of that level has a tendency to be a wake up call. 

Im not ready to give up, and neither is she. But, we just don't know where to go from here. I love her, but she is so difficult to talk to. I've gotten to the point that i've basically stopped talking about my issues cause I know it'll just set her off. But, she knows me well enough to know that something is bothering me and my refusal to talk about it, of course, sets her off.

The hardest points are when she is having a break down, I just freeze cause I have no idea what to say. I just sit there and stare while she loses it cause i'm at a loss at how to help. I know that what she is feeling is real to her, I get that. But as an outsider, and an autistic one at that, looking in it all just seems so completely irrational that I cannot conceive how anyone can think like that.

How do I bring up my issues with her without her feeling like it's a personal attack or getting her to feel like shes the worst person alive? How do I learn to not take the things she says and does personally myself? And most importantly, what do I do when she is at the point that she is breaking down and is talking about how she would be better off dead? I just need some advice on how to make this work.

"Persistent Ideation I've been confident in my eventual suicide for more than 15 years. I think about it pretty much everyday, especially after my mom offed herself too.

Recently I met someone new (yes, a new FP) who actually makes me excited and enthusiastic about waking up in the mornings. We've made tons of plans for the future, want to spend life together, etc. For about a month or maybe a little more, I decided that yes, I still am suicidal, but maybe not today. Maybe not even tomorrow. 

Unfortunately, all that giddiness has already worn off. He's still my FP and still am excited and I still want to be with him. I haven't even split on him at this point. But I'm back to wanting to die RIGHT NOW, RIGHT THIS SECOND. 

Why do I still feel this way, persistently and compulsively, even when I have something happy and good and stable to look forward to?

I feel so stupid for letting myself fall for her bullshit. I've been in so much pain because of her, when I always knew she was a bad person.

"Everyone is Leaving Me! O.k., so this is going to be long. The T.L. D.R. is this: All my care providers (therapists, med people,case workers, care coordinators etc.) are quitting, and so are their replacements.  Someone was fired for embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars and probably is the real reason we lost our day program. I just found out about three more people quitting today, and I am scared that I will lose all the professional support I have.

Now for the long post.  So, my therapist of seven years retired about two and a half years ago (I think).  Her replacement didn't even stay a year!  At the same time her replacement left, so did my med provider.  Also, my case worker left about a year ago. My new case worker left a few months after that. I have a therpaist now, but she just left the mental health center for a different practice. Fortunately it is still in town and I can (and have) followed her there.  I have a med provider at the mental health center, and she doesn't seem to be going anywhere, but that's what we thought about others who quit.  I have a new case worker too, she has been with me since March. I am worried that if more people leave the mental health center, it will close. But, I have a friend who works there as a peer support specialist. She has similar worries. However, she tells me they are now hiring new people (they had a hiring freeze for a bit), and she thinks things will be fine. I hope so.

I also get in home services through a company that does SCL (supported community living). This company also runs the RCF (residential care facility) that I lived in before moving out into the community.  They used to have a day program, but that ended about a year ago.  At the time it ended, they said (and believed) it was because the insurance companies weren't paying the bills like they were supposed to.  Later on, it was discovered that the head administrator of the company was embezzling large sums of money from the staff and clients.  We now wonder if perhaps the insurance companies were paying, but the money wasn't going where it needed to go.  She was of course fired, and is out on bail awaiting trial.

One of my favorite people at the company had to take on a LOT of extra responsibility (and she already did a TON) when this happened.  We were worried she might quit.  She called us and assured us she wasn't quitting.  They found a replacement administrator. I thought maybe things were getting better. Then today, I learned that the person who said they wouldn't quit just did.  No one knows why. She was on vacation, came back, packed up all her things and left a resignation letter.  Two other important people are also quitting.  This will leave everyone short staffed until replacements can be found, and there aren't many people lining up for jobs like these

My friends and I are all worried that maybe we will lose our services and have to switch to a different company.  We hope not, but with everyone quitting we are getting worried.  We are good supports for each other, but it is kind of hard not to feel abandoned when so many people leave.  I hold nothing against my original long term therapist.  I was worried when I first started seeing her that she would retire soon (wasn't sure how old she was, but she wasn't young).  I was grateful that I had her for seven years.  Everyone else, well, it kinda makes me mad.  I know they have their reasons for leaving, but I feel as if they really cared about me they wouldn't leave. (I know that's not really true, but well, you know how it is).  A lot of the problems started when our state privatized medicaid.  They hired three private companies to take over.  The company I had was great. I got a free YMCA membership, and I think they were the one company that actually paid their bills.  They pulled out after a year because it was too expensive for them.  So, we were left with two companies. One refused to take any new members, so all the people who had the company that pulled out had to go to the other company.  Neither of the two left are paying bills in a timely manner. Also, they are denying necessary treatment for many disabled people.  It's bad. When problems first started arising, my friends and I wrote letters to our governor and our local representatives.  Only the governor wrote back, and she just told us how great everything was going, and a bunch of other B.S.  We have voted against her, and we hope her opponent wins in November, but we aren't sure how it will go.

I really hope no one else quits. I really hope we don't lose any more services. (There was a sheltered workshop in town also, I no longer worked there, but I used to. It closed down a few months ago as well.  This has to do with a federal law requiring sheltered workshops to close by 2019.) ",BPD

"It happened again. This fucking condition, it's a fucking disease which is such a fucking curse. It's one extreme to another - I'd like to think by now I can control it but recently I think my brain is tricking me and it's becoming worse. Huge bust up with boyfriend where we both decided if we needed to break up, we'd be way more open to it happening than we were before. Frustrating and obviously as upsetting as that is, I feel like a useless excuse as a person. Applied for more than 30 jobs, not a single interview back. My university degree is no longer interesting to me, I don't give a fuck about the lessons. What's the point? I genuinely have lost all my ambitions and will to want to do things and succeed, i'm 18 and express a deep desire to not want to live past my early 20's, most likely going at 23/24. I've been suicidal before, but not to this extreme before, I can't see the ""light at the end of the tunnel"", just extreme darkness pulling, calling me in.

"Social Anxiety & BPD My boyfriend was hanging out with a friend, and at the start of our relationship always invited me places because he wanted his ideal partner to be friends with his friends. Last night I asked why he didn't invite me to hang out with them and he said ""it's just going to be me hanging out with my friend and you being silent in the corner, so it doesn't make a difference if I invite you"". That really really hurt. It's something I've been experiencing since high school, where I'd sit in a group and my internal dialogue would be ""say something, find something to contribute to this conversation"" and my mind blanking, and then thinking five minutes later ""oh shit they were talking about cats, you had cats, you could have said something then!"" but by the time I think that the conversation has already progressed. 

I told him it really hurt and he said ""am I wrong though?"" and he wasn't, so I tried to explain that it made me feel unloved, or like he thought I was less of a person because of that. He said it wasn't and that he accepts me for who I am, which is awkward, but he loves me and just doesn't expect me to be less-shy, and is loves me regardless. 

I guess I should be happy but it hurt even more that he thinks I'm not capable, especially when I've tried very hard to even go to these situations and stop saying no when he asks me to come out, because I genuinely have wanted to be there and make an effort despite being anxious the whole time. It also hurts that he doesn't realize how hard it is for me...and that asking an anxious person to speak more before we reach a place, only makes me shut down even more. 

It also hurts that he doesn't see all the things I've accomplished despite my social anxiety, like we met because I was singing at a band gig that his band was playing at, in public. I was also doing weekly solo gigs singing, and he knows that. I've spent a lot of time doing public speaking activities just to push myself out of my comfort zone, like a program talking to freshman about consent, and workshops to frat guys about bystander intervention. I now work with perpetrators of domestic violence. I'm a young looking, 5 foot tall, 22 year old, and these are all huge deals to me, especially because of the amount of social anxiety I've had to overcome to do these things. When he said he loved me for who I am which is, socially awkward, it hurt because it felt like he was saying ""I love you despite your flaws"", which could definitely be in my head but it still feels like an insult, when I wish he could see what I've done to work on it before we even met. I just wish he had said ""I love you for persisting, and trying so hard despite the anxiety"". 

I'm not sure how to talk to him about this without sounding like I'm cocky or throwing accomplishments in his face to get him to love me. ",BPD
"Dreams of the military to be crushed by a diagnosis I don't want to be one of those people that Google's their symptoms and thinks they are going to die of someone unknown disease or whatever. But I have been thinking and researching bpd for a while now. I know I have a lot of issues with mental health but I refuse to see a therapist. My goal in like is to be an officer in the military. I want work in public health and anti terrorism. The only issue is the military most likely won't let me in if I have a diagnosis of anything pretty much. I want to be in the military so badly, it's what I've always wanted. But I'm struggling so much now and keep trudging forwards knowing I'll be doing something Ive always wanted soon.

While logically I know this is unhealthy behavior and it's good that we're no longer talking, but the fact that he left me has me very very upset. 

I feel betrayed and hurt and angry. I feel depressed and alone. I know this feeling will go away but when people leave I just go back to an almost child like state where I feel like life isn't worth anything and eventually anyone I love or care about will abandon me too.

"Medication and marijuana Hey everyone. I was recently diagnosed with BPD, and started taking Latuda for two weeks, but there were too many side effects. My psychiatrist switched me to Abilify instead. 

So far, it is making me very tired, and my coworkers have noticed that while I was taking Latuda, I looked and acted differently. I was sort of expressionless, and just acting ""mad"" they said. 

For some reason, this bothers me, and I really don't want to be on medication, but as far as my moods go, it is actually helping me. The doc said I need to stop smoking weed, also. I've been smoking almost every day for about two years and I am going on my third week without smoking. It is very difficult, and I really wish I didn't have to stop. 

My question here is, is it safe to smoke marijuana while on Abilify, and should I continue the medication? I'm pretty torn right now, because I want to get better but I'm not sure if this is the right way. I just need some advice on how to cope with this all, I suppose. ",BPD

Polyamorous debates aside (given this is my first and only relationship of that type; it's something I'm experimenting with), I want to make sure I handle the spirals correctly in order to keep her the most safe as well as help her grow. 

I realize a lot of context will be missing in making this post, but I thought I'd post it to see what people thought based on their own experiences. She originally claimed to have BPD years ago, but in this phone conversation pre-text, I showed her a BPD article about FPs I thought she might relate to and that spiraled her into her thinking I was accusing her of being ""untouchable"" because of that diagnosis so I told her if she didn't want to define herself by it, I wouldn't either. But, that she could still fall on the spectrum and any knowledge should be useful to help her grow.

6. 
7.

"What I learned about dating a man with BPD, and having it myself. I broke up with my boyfriend today.
10 months. 10 long months of highs and lows. Hot and cold. 
I love this man with every single inch of my soul. I can say this with confidence, because despite his behavior I have stayed. I watched him break, build back up and break again. 
I learned a lot about my own BPD and how shitty it feels when you're the FP instead of the other way around.
Watching his behaviors has taught me so much, and I feel incredibly lucky to have been loved by him, despite how short and I don't know if I could ever stop loving him but I want to use this experience to educate. I loved, I learned, I am better for it and I want to pass this along to everyone else. 
He is impulsive. He gave into every bit of emotion the moment it hit him. He couldn't control it. My heart broke over and over when I saw him punch the table or the wall and yell. There's a constant battle we fight in our minds and he was at war with himself. This part resonates the most. 
I tried to level with him, tell him i understood but he pushed me away at every corner. I stayed up late with him while he cried in my lap asking for forgiveness. He hates this too, he doesn't know why he's like this. I feel his suffering and I just want to make it ok. 

But I can't. So I stepped away now.

I don't want to. I love him so much, I can't imagine life without him. His sweet smile, his gentle laugh. My heart is breaking. I don't want to give go on him like everyone else in his life has.

"Dating and intimacy just doesn't make sense to me Male quiet borderline here. 

I don't know if it's my issues with opening up and belong vulnerable or if it's just my social anxiety, but dating, even in theory, just seems impossible. I'm so lost and broken that I've almost deluded myself into thinking that everything related to dating, sex, intimacy, etc. is just a massive lie and doesn't exist—for me at least. 

As much as I want to experience all these things it almost feels wrong—as if I'm not allowed to. Every time I'm talking to a woman or trying to flirt (as if I can even fully grasp that), it feels so alien and unreal that I just want to run away and cry. It probably doesn't help that I'll often dissociate mid conversation. 

The thing is, I KNOW all of the social dynamics and behavior in my head—that's not the issue. But when I go to actually have ME do it, it feels like when I was a child and I would try to go the ""grownups table."" No matter what I know, do, or say the entire thing is utterly incompatible.

"If I was ever in doubt of my diagnosis... (major abandonment issues) I shouldn't have been in doubt because the abandonment issues and the crazy they produce is strong in me.

I had a fight with my best friend on Saturday and although we messaged back and forth on the Sunday, she was ignoring my messages on Tuesday and yesterday.

So, I convinced myself that she will never talk to me again, that she will call up my ex who is sort of my enemy now and be buddies with him, and this insane desperation came over me. I began thinking of ways I can manipulate her into talking to me, mainly by guilt tripping her or lying about something random. Then I thought, if that doesn't work, I will throw myself off a cliff (I think about suicide pretty much every day anyway) because I just can't live with more people abandoning me.

The logical, mature part of me knows that all of that is wrong and unhealthy. And that if someone decides they don't want anything to do with me anymore it is their right and I should respect their choice. Why does it feel like I will die if a person I care about seems like they will leave? 

This shit caused my ex-boyfriend (who I was with for most of my 20s - 8 years) to cut all contact with me and he wants nothing to do with me now. My 'frantic efforts to avoid abandonment' which were emotionally abusive, became a self-fulfilling prophecy. I was so crazy and scary he had no choice but to cut all contact for his own sanity and so he could move on with his life, because I wasn't letting him. 

I would say that this is the symptom of BPD that probably causes the most shit for me and for people I care about.

I'm only ok now because my best friend texted me. In seconds a wave of calm and normality came over me. But I don't want to have my sanity dependent on whether or not people will stick around.

I moved back home two weeks ago. My parents are having extreme drama, and I'm being put in the middle of it. I knew living at home as is would screw me up, because being around my parents causes me to become hypervigilant and dissociate, but things are significantly worse than I expected.

I don't want to go into detail because my boyfriend is a private person, and now that the damage is done (it takes me a few days to realize), I actually know exactly what I did wrong: I victimized myself and put the blame on him when he simply addressed his needs. With the next issue, I refused to acknowledge I dissociate/gaslight him sometimes when he told me it's causing him not to trust me. This resulted in me cursing him out and threatening a breakup. Then, as soon as he forgave me for all of that, I accused of him being a bad influence when he started trying to help my family.

This has all happened in the course of about 10 days without a single day in-between. He keeps telling me he's been dealing with me constantly doing this for a year and a half, and he's tired of all of the gaslighting, selective memory, blowing up, and threats. He says he's tired of me ""playing"" and all he asks is for me to at least watch my mouth when I talk to him.

I don't know what to do anymore. It's pretty clear I've split on him, and I can't seem to snap out of it. We do argue often because of me, but it usually doesn't last this long. How can I stop splitting black on my boyfriend? Should I stop talking to him for a few days?

"Coping strategy for jealousy? My jealousy has become much more manageable over the years, but sometimes it raises its irrational head and I kind of shut down because the negative thoughts and feelings are overwhelming.

For example: my partner of five years and I are currently long distance and have different hobbies we participate in as individuals. She loves to cosplay and go to conventions with her friends, and I prefer more quiet, solo activities. This usually isn't a problem, as we have many other things we do together, but sometimes when she goes to cons I feel moody and left out. It doesn't help that the cons she visits usually occur during the holidays or other 'family' oriented times, when I wish we could spend time together. 

I can rationalize and understand that she NEEDS activities with other people and needs to work on her hobbies because it's good for her, but emotionally I'm all over the place. I feel jealous, I feel guilty for being jealous, I feel sad, I feel angry, and it just devolves into a spiral of negative thoughts and feelings.

I think I did okay last time she went, I gave her space and chose not to text or bug her because I really wanted her to have fun with her friends. Tried to do some of my solo activities, but it was hard to concentrate while feeling so out of sorts. 

This year I wanted us to spend her Christmas break together, since we've not done that yet, and I found out she can't because she's going to the con. I feel bad for feeling disappointed / sad over it, but I've been doing my best to be support her and encourage her to do things for herself.

How can I healthily cope with disappointment and jealousy while giving my partner my unconditional support? 

Note: I don't want to ask to be included in her solo activities / separate hobbies. I'd rather she get time to herself with her friends without feeling like she needs to include me in everything, you know? I just want to figure out a good way to deal with unsavory feelings and anxieties. ",BPD
"Does Anyone Else Come Off Cold And Distant? My family came over for Christmas and the whole time I felt kind of distant. I'm not sure if it was a previous meltdown months prior to this (which was when they all found out I have Borderline), or it was me being me. I have a dark sense of humor so I made a stupid joke when my uncle threw a napkin into the fire. It went like this.
My sister : ""Ah there goes the napkin.""
Me : *watching it burn in the fire* ""Yeah...Just like my hopes and dreams"".
My uncle : *basically quietly says something about going to the other side of the fire and does so*.
After that he said he needed to tell his wife something and he'd do it later. I wasn't sure if this was about me or anything. I just felt like shit afterwards. This wasn't even the only incident. Earlier that day, he asked me where I was sleeping and I made a joke like ""What? Sleep? Sleep is for the weak!"" And he gave me a strange look and said, ""Okay."" This, too, made me feel like shit, because I was just trying to joke and I feel like I just make him uncomfortable. I told my mom about it and she's just like, ""Well you never involve yourself in anything."" And I told her I was uncomfortable doing so and she just said ""I'm sorry."" 
I read a post on here, and it said, ""Unfortunately if you're family isn't giving you love or support, stop seeking it from them."" I guess I realize now I'm in that boat and I gotta suck it up. I'm truly alone aren't I? I mean yeah, I have a boyfriend, but I feel soon he'll get tired of my shit too and leave. But that's just Borderline, right?",BPD

God nothing I'm trying is working to hide what I've written. I'm not even good at the internet.

Does anyone else ever push people away with the thought that the further you are from them, the less they'll be hurt when you inevitably commit (the imagined) suicide?

Like this sounds grim and dark and it probably is, but I don't see a future for myself where I don't commit suicide before 30. And sometimes when I push friends away, my internal rationale is that I'm doing this so that they won't like me when I commit suicide and therefore won't be hurt by it. Maybe it's an excuse I make for myself when I'm pushing people away even though friendships and relationships are what I so desperately crave. But idk it's the idea in my head when I'm starting to push people away. Like I'll think ""it's best if we're not friends anymore anyways, that way they won't be hurt by my death""",BPD

"How Can I Make A Change? ***TW: Abuse, self-harm***

​

On the 23rd of this month, my girlfriend of 11 months broke up with me and I immediately shut down. I cut, I cried... A lot... Tried to reason with her, the one that I thought for sure was going to be the love of my life, the one I'd propose to and the one I would be with forever, after all, she felt the same, right? And so I went on social media the next day asking for some kind words and help from others.

​

Even though I was so obviously (personally speaking, not public knowledge) the reason for the break-up. I was physically abusive, and I let my impulsive behavior and anger best me on several occasions, causing what her and I called ""Gerald"" to come out and immediately, for no reason, want to hurt and damage her in any way Gerald could. Whether it be from kissing her too hard against her will, pinning her down and bad-mouthing her, or just grinning ear to ear while my brain tried to fight off the urge to just tear every piece of clothing off her body. During the latter bit of our relationship, I was a domestic abuser, and while I didn't like it, and while I cut myself and cried after every time it happened I never bothered to try and find a way out of doing this.

​

It just wasn't nor felt like it was... Me, but it was still a part of me, and I can't deny that. I am responsible for that trauma and I am responsible for being too tired, too depressed, too whatever, and not caring enough in general to get help after the first signs of Gerald started popping out. 

​

Can I honestly say I didn't expect this breakup? Well... No, not really, because for the previous two nights I had had nightmares about it, about her leaving me, about her not wanting anything to do with me, yknow, that sort of thing. I joked about it a lot too, that I won't ever be able to have a good relationship because of this disorder, that I'm too destructive and too far gone to be able to have a long-lasting relationship that was healthy. I really did have it coming, and yet I really did not prepare myself one bit. Which in turn made me realize how much of a fool I am, and how desperately I need to change, not because I feel ashamed (Guilty yes, ashamed no), not because I don't want to deal with the consequences and no so I can feel like I have a free pass if it were to happen again. I need to change because I want to change, and this was the kick in the fucking ass that I needed to actually get my gears spinning and acknowledge that uh wow... I really do need to get out and get some help, because I ain't gonna let this happen again, I ain't gonna hurt anyone that I love anymore and especially not her. Although I can't erase the trauma done to her and I, I can at least try to better myself for the next person or situation that comes along.

​

So this is why I've come to this thread, for help, for any sort of assistance or guidance I can get. Whether it's personal advice, articles you've read, videos, books, websites and apps... Anything really. I want this change, I just need help getting there, no matter how many steps I have to take. And please, if there are questions please ask, I am so open about this it's insane. Also this was a gay relationship... If that has any value or changes the narrative? Idk

​

"what BPD feels like on the inside for sufferers. sharing experiences lets us all know we are not alone. I have read many papers and books on BPD but I feel that they are all lacking in being able to describe what we sufferers feel like from an insiders point of view. The definition of psychological pain pales in comparison to what it actually feels like inside of someone who suffers from it. 


The Wikipedia definition demonstrates exactly how much psychological pain BPD sufferers experience, but lacks the personal first hand descriptions of what this feels like to someone that suffers from the disease. I am writing a paper about what this really feels like to the people who suffer through this day in and out. 
I am hoping to gather personal stories from those that have to fight this intense pain simply to get out of bed in the morning, to find yourself important enough to shower and eat properly, to try to get to bed at a decent time and to find the motivation to do it all again tomorrow. BPD sufferers have the greatest amount of attempted and successful suicide attempts, much greater than any other mental illness.


I need some personal stories about how it actually feels inside BPD sufferers, and ones about how far we are willing to go to stop the constant suffering inside. please try to share the ruminating negative thoughts that you experience, the feelings that make you feel worthless, like no one could possibly be able to love someone like you, examples of the black or white feelings that effect your everyday life, how debilitating thoughts and actions that make it so hard for you to maintain a normal life, what makes maintaining relationships near impossible for you. Describe as well as you can the internal arguments that make your life and decision making processes that is unbearable, the anxiety, and any other symptoms you experience that make life so hard for you, but other s seem to breeze through with no problems.


If you are interested in helping me put together this more personal side of what BPD feels like inside of you please contact me through my email- ganeshavs.world@gmail.com, i can give you my phone number after you send me something indicating that you are serious about sharing how difficult this disease is from your personal viewpoint. I believe that in putting this together it may be a tool for those that feel that they are all alone in this awful endless suffering and maybe even relay to others good personal insight on how to deal with these things, or show other sufferers ways to make it bearable. Of course I will not use your name or any of your personal information other than the stories and tips that you would like to pass along to others. if you feel more secure using a pseudonym please do so. I simply want to put something together with more of a personal angle than a clinical definition and show sufferers that they are not alone. Also I believe it may help to heal some of your internal pain by sharing your story, and help to reduce some of the pain in those that believe they are alone in this and need some tip and guidance to make it through extreme low points, knowing that there are others who have been in all that pain and came out the other side.  I truly believe that this could help other sufferers, including myself. please contact me if you are interested.

As with most revelations on bpd I've gained insights about it as soon as it was bought up.

Thankfully he is a great, understanding, loving , and patient person who understands that I'm confused and sick. The problem is my current FP. I told my therapist(and him) that he has never ever even so much as rubbed me the wrong way. Never annoyed me or anything in the two years I have known him. (I'm a guy btw) my therapist says that this is a major red flag. Maybe I'm idealizing him. It's scary to think of what may happen if he disappoints or angers me. I can see now how that could be a major disaster. I've been trying to see some gray with him. Only thing I can think of is that he flirts with other girls when he has a GF but doesn't cheat.  Only bad quality I can find. Still haven't been able to reconcile the gray with my last FP with over a year of complete obsession over it.

"Bpd newly diagnosed Hey there, so I've been newly diagnosed, I live in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice for me or knows anywhere good around me that has Dbt therapy? Anything would help at this point. 

To explain my diagnosis, I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and bipolar/borderline personality disorder. 

Im on abilify, Cymbalta and Lyrica. They seem to be doing an okay job but I still feel out of whack. I still have mood swings and I still get depressed and suicidal when things upset me. To the point where I counted out a lethal dosage of my med's and sat there contemplating whether or not to take them whilst bawling my eyes out. 

My mood swings last anywhere from mere seconds to weeks or months. I get angry very easily and explode about alot and hold onto things for a very long time. I've had a problem in the past with being an addict to pills, alcohol and gambling. Now it's just gambling that I can't seem to kick. I get very paranoid about everyone's intentions, thinking they're only being nice because they want something or they want to hurt me or worse. I forget a lot all of the time and I'm afraid my memory is only getting worse with time. I feel empty on the inside most of the time. Like my emotions are fake and that I'm just acting for the sake of others. I have really poor impulse control, I spend money that I know we don't have and I make rash decisions about things like groceries and what I'm going to do and how to react to things. I react either wildly our of prompting or not at all. 

I'm just looking for help. Please. ",BPD

"Reddit, how have you noticed improvement with treatment? This week I checked myself into inpatient care for my depression because I knew my symptoms had gotten too intense for me to handle on my own.  My symptoms over the past year had been getting worse; my rumination about the past, moments of lashing out at people I care about, mood swings, suicidal ideation, anxiety, inability to control my intimate relationships, and cognitive decline/confusion. After hearing about my symptoms the doctor diagnosed me with BPD and suddenly it all makes sense. My behavior in the past: putting all my cards on the table at once, feeling betrayed/insecure/abandoned, passionate idealizations... all very BPD. It's both terrifying and relieving to know it's not my fault. 

Obviously it's something I'm struggling to accept. A psychological disorder is a lot harder to depersonalize than a purely neurological one (even though it's both right?). I've always considered myself as one who relishes the world as morally grey, never black and white, and now I know I have a disorder that forces me into those corners. 

 In any case I'm trying to think about what the future looks like for me. These past few months I've been gaining steam combatting depression, I'm not stopping now that I know it's something else. 

I want to hear how treatment works for some of you. How has DBT (I start today) been a benefit to your symptoms? Has anybody tried transference-focused psychotherapy? In what ways have you noticed your relationships improving as you incorporate your treatment?

I feel like I need help more than ever. Over the past year or so I've slowly thought more and more about checking myself into a hospital somewhere to seek help for my mental health.

Not in that moment but I constantly think about how that's how I'm going to die because I do get very suicidal and depressed. I don't really trust myself when I'm alone cause normally I end up hurting myself in some way or all I do is panic.  I genuinely feel like I need serious help or I'm just going to continue down this horrible road I'm on my with my mental health.

"Dating with BPD is such TORTURE Why is dating  with BPD literally the most stressful and difficult thing ever? The cycle goes a bit like this: 

-they show interest 
-I'm into it
-we hang out 
-If they are unique and special, I am immediately imagining marriage and our future life (special for me it is usually someone with a nice voice and artistic talent)
- still able to maintain facade of normalcy as long as the person is responding to my messages within a few hours and the convo is two sided
- intimacy happens (usually way too soon)
-if the sex was good, attachment is now at point of no return
-now the overthinking begins - are they seeing other people? I need to feel special too- they're not responding as much as they used to, why haven't they asked me out yet on another date? Oh ok we have a date for Friday - can't wait! But hey it's only Tuesday, what are they doing the rest of the week that can't wait? Oh they're not gonna be home tonight? A break in texting - they must be sleeping with other people! Why can't they see how special I am and sleep with me instead? Come to think of it they really don't seem to care much about me at all...man, this is messed up this person just wants sex. I refuse to play that role, I need to be worshipped for the amazing human I am. This person isn't gonna do that. Don't text them tho, keep it to yourself you're overreacting, no I'm not, they'll never love me the way I need to be loved, I'll just end it now because I can't bear to spend the weekend with this person only to have to deal with them sleeping around again next week. This is too much anxiety for me. Fuck dating it's too hard I just want someone to love me and make me feel safe like I would for them.   I need to break this off I have a bad gut feeling about where this is going and I will not be able to handle the rejection cuz they should already know by now that we're soulmates and since they don't know that yet, there  is no point continuing this relationship they will never love me the way I need to be loved 
-breaks up with person in a way that makes them feel like they did something wrong 
-immediate regret - wait I need to be with them! What have I done!?! Theyre so talented and special i cant bear to see them end up with someone else! 
- beg for forgiveness and try to get them to give you another chance  
- get blocked for being bat shit crazy 
-stalk them on social media anyway and spend weeks and weeks in agony and obsessive despair- idealization: they were perfect I would give anything to see them again, this person is everything and I blew it. I feel
So embarassed about how i acted maybe ill just kill myself to end this agony, its too much, i will do anything to get another chance. This no contact is so hard why arent they unblocking me yet? Didnt they see how perfect we could be?  Im gonna be alone foreverrrrrr!!!!!!!
-agony period only ends when new crush emerges to take over the old one or the haplesss victim returns for the sex
-eventually a giant cancer is added to the cycle - finding an abusive person with their own mental health issues who's willing to stick around cuz they suck too, be in abusive relationship for years and have extreme trouble ending it even when ita clear that its toxic.

"My estranged brother was diagnosed with BPD and is now lashing out at family. What can I do? I haven't spoken to my brother for almost 9 years now after several years before that of him being very unstable and, to be frank, toxic.  We were close when I was younger, around 18 until he dated/married a girl I was close with in high school against my urging to stay away from her (she's a whole other story, I'll answer questions on her but I can't seem to sum up in a nutshell why them being together was such a bad idea), and he declined deeper into paranoia and would lash out at me and my other siblings often.  At 22 I decided that if he didn't want to help himself at all I couldn't handle him in my life.  I know how selfish that sounds but I was young and not prepared to handle whatever was going on with him.  My mom (who I am also not close with) was diagnosed with BPD two years later and later that same year so was he, but while my mom at the very least chose to start an antidepressant regimen, he rejected the diagnosis and accused me personally of trying to poison him (I had almost no contact with him at this point in our lives as I had tried to distance myself).


Recently my oldest sister got back in contact with him to see how he was doing, as well as to ask him for a favor; she needed some semi-personal documents for a legal proceeding, to which he agreed to assist in obtaining.  After just a few interactions with my oldest sister (a long phone call where they discussed politics, then texts where he would send her conspiracy theory links on youtube and assert that it was news) he sent her a text late at night lashing out and retracting the offer to help.  He then texted the oldest brother and apologized for ""dishonoring"" him in a message he sent to oldest sister.  Both siblings then reached out to me to ensure that he hadn't sent me anything.


The text itself was three screens long and contained a lot of rhetoric about the government, attacked my sister, her husband, and their 11yo son, claimed that he had talked to 6 adults who all said that my nephew is a ""bad apple"" (he doesn't have access to anyone who has interacted with my nephew in 9 years), and insinuating that my oldest brother is a drug dealer.  It's not that the behavior is out of character for him, but this feels more serious than usual.  My initial reaction was to go see him and tell him how hurtful that was, but honestly I don't want to get sucked back into anything unless I feel a little more prepared for what is going on.  And that's where I'm at, I don't have any idea how to help him, or if I should even try given that he's unwilling to seek treatment.  He's burning bridges that are already weak to begin with but I honestly think he might be getting worse by isolating himself.  


So here's my question... what are the best literature/resources to get to better educate myself about BPD?  And is there anything that someone who actually has BPD can recommend that would shed some light on what it's like for him?

"Diagnosed with GAD with ""borderline personality traits"" and destroying my relationship I [19F] love my boyfriend [21M]. I'm convinced this is the person I'm going to spend the rest of my life with. We've been together for two years, and we've lived together for a year and a half. I'm single-handedly destroying our relationship.  

I don't know how I ended up with the most patient, loving, and understanding man on the planet, but I did. Not once has he snapped at me, gotten angry with me (or at least hasn't shown it) or cursed at me. He has been nothing but a saint throughout this DISASTER.  

I have weeks like this week where I'm completely clear in my head and I love him more than anything in the world. My chest feels giddy at the thought of him, our sex life is incredible, we make each other cry laughing and I can't get enough of him. I have weeks (more frequent than the good weeks) where I hate his guts. The thought of him makes me sick and I want to leave him for good. I have episodes where I scream disgusting insults at him and rip apart our apartment.  

I know his patience won't last forever. I can tell I'm changing him - he feels like he's walking on eggshells, he tiptoes around me. He doesn't feel comfortable or safe in his own home. He deserves so much better, and I don't know why he's still here, living with a monster. He promises me over and over he's never going to leave, that he'll be here through everything, but I just can't accept that. It's not fair to him. 

My diagnosis is new, but I've always known I've had BPD symptoms. I've been saying it over and over to my primary care doctor and therapist but they weren't hearing me. I was referred to a new psychiatrist (that I LOVE) and he changed my diagnosis from bipolar 2 to generalized anxiety disorder with borderline personality traits, without me even mentioning BPD. It was the biggest relief I've ever felt, I actually had a name for what was happening to me. The bipolar symptoms just didn't match up to the feeling of a demon taking over my body that destroys everything in sight for 30mins-1 hour.

I've been lurking this sub for a while now and I feel so at home. I felt so alone, so crazy, like there wasn't a name for what was happening to me and I was just insane. I cried tears of happiness when I found r/BPD and everyone was describing what I felt.

"how can two people with BPD be so wildly different? Basically I met this girl online who has BPD and she has all the classic signs; self harm, unstable identity, low self esteem, suicidal ideation, extreme emotions, unstable relationships.

And I have been diagnosed too, and have these things too, but hearing about her symptoms, relationships and behaviors makes me feel like I'm an impostor, maybe even misdiagnosed. I feel fake compared to her.

What we differ on is basically how much we draw attention to ourselves, and how we interact with people. She jumps from relationship to relationship, discarding people easily because she doesn't really like them and merely used them. She's cruel and hostile, she lacks empathy. She's a magnet for people who want to save her and serve her, even though she could care less about them. She seems more ""unstable"" and ""scarred"" in a sense. Maybe like a femme fatale? Or just a heartless heartbreaker.

I just bottle up, silently self destruct and sabotage. My relationships are few because I either love somebody and give them my all to the point of obsession, or I want nothing to do with them. I hate being abandoned and cling to scary levels. I can quickly turn on somebody and cut ties, but instead of using people I feel inferior to everyone. I let myself be used and preyed on. I'm seen as weak, meek and unassuming, and I hate drawing attention to myself even though I wish I was great. Loved. Feared. Obsessed over. But I don't make people fall in love with me and later discard them, I just disappear.

If she's Wrath and Pride, I'm Lust and Envy.

I don't know, but when I think of her I feel really fake, even though I know BPD symptoms vary wildly. ",BPD
"I'm mad at a lot of people and I want to rub their faces in my success. I have been doubted since birth, told I couldn't do things I went ahead and did anyway. Just took me longer. Here's my music Music teacher at university said I couldn't cut it in the music program because I was too emotional. Got straight As and wrote and recorded four albums. Been in a rock band for ten years with the same people and have written 20 songs with them and played almost 400 shows. After minoring in piano I taught myself the ukulele two years ago because why not?

Exboyfriends said I couldn't sing. People at work think I'm full of shit so I don't talk about music to them. Maybe I'm too ugly and weird for people to think I can make music because musical ability is associated with hot young girls? Who knows. But i'm good. here's my soundcloud. [

When you have BPD everything is ten times harder. I know I'll never be able to play with the big boys but I still show up. I get out of bed and I show up and I put myself out there and it still sounds pretty good. I'm proud of it.",BPD
"Break up make up cycle is making me feel depressed I'm in this horrible situation right now that's really hard because BPD is clouding my judgement. I've been on and off with this guy for five months now and even though it's clear that it's not working, it's so hard to let go and I feel really on edge about it. My fear is that if I let it go, I'll be left with no one because all my friends right now are our mutual friends and I really want to keep them. Also, whenever I feel confident breaking it off, about two -three days later I start feeling really depressed and I miss him and miss the company and the attention and then we hang out as friends, but it always turns into a reconciliation and we're back together and it's nice for about a week then turns bad again. Honestly, it's just the problem of how selfish he gets and how he treats me sometimes more like one of his lad mates than his girlfriend and doesn't give me enough affection or attention and I start feeling really alone and unattractive. He doesn't even realise he's doing this and we've talked about it a lot but it doesn't seem to change things.

Tonight I broke up with him again after a two hour phone call about how I find his behaviour to be really frustrating and I can't deal with it and I don't feel happy, I've even put on weight for the first time in years because I'm so frustrated and depressed about it. I want to keep things broken up but he's already telling me that he wants to be with me and that he wants to try harder and all of this but I know that it's his personality to be the way he is and he can't help it and it's not what I want. I would be fine being friends with him I think but this whole thing is too much now that I feel just flat and emotionless and helpless. I just wish there was a way for me to keep our mutual friends without him, but I know that's impossible because they like him just as much as me and we both met them together pretty much so it would be too unfair to ask them to choose. So I want him to just say 'ok, let's be friends' but he won't do that either so I'm stuck pretty much... any advice?",BPD
"Going back to ex who you know is no good for you Hey all, looking for support while I continuous make terrible life decisions.

My ex and I were together 3 years of many highs and lows. I know I have my issues but he also had some narcissistic traits that basically sucked the life out of me. Near the end, he wasn't working, drinking every day, would never be able to get in contact with him and finally I hit my emotional breaking point and he left me. No explanation, just a minute phone call saying were done and then ghosted me for almost a month before coming back.

For this past month I have been working out almost every day, eating right, reconnecting eith friends and have dug myself out of the hole I was in. He has continued to drink, party, fuck around with the girl that was 'just a friend' and not to worry about (and I'm supposed to believe that shit wasn't happening when you were always disappearing?) And now wants to reconnect. He's making lots of promises and is just being the guy I wanted. But I know it's an act. 

3 years of emotional abuse, gaslighting,manipulating, lying and most likely cheating not to mention abandoning me at my lowest and I'm honestly considering taking him back. I know this is a terrible decision. I know I will get hurt again. I know he won't be able to keep this act up for long before his true colours show but here I am! Ready to get fucked over again! 

I don't know why I keep doing this to myself. All of my friends, family, therapist make sure I know it's a bad decision and bring up great points but my head is just stuck. Does anyone else do this? I just need someone to talk to because no one else understands and fuck, I don't either.

"Is there hope for the future, who is doing well? please say something. Is anyone doing well and thriving?  I need a little hope for the future here.

"Proud of Myself I haven't posted here before, but I don't have anyone else to tell about this accomplishment. TLDR at the bottom.

On Monday my girlfriend moved to Norway. She is going there for grad school and I am so incredibly proud of her. We have only been dating for six months, and the fact that she was moving away was understood at the beginning of the relationship. We also officially established boundaries for being polyamorous and having other partners. Furthermore, I moved in with her mother (long story), which is an interesting dynamic. And on top of everything, I've been having severe migraines everyday for the past month and don't currently have a therapist. Basically, there have been a lot of life changes going on for me and I was nervous about how I would handle it.

Since my girlfriend has been in Norway she is only able to talk or text when she is on WiFi. As you can imagine, this is a bit stressful for me. There is also a six hour time difference. During the past week of this I have been plagued with fears of abandonment. I think these are stemming from the migraines (I'm in pain, so I talk/complain about it and therefore feel like a burden and become scared that she'll leave) and the discussions of polyamory. 

Though I am excited about opening up our relationship, I am scared of how I will react when she gets another partner. I have of course shared these concerns with her, and she has also expressed that she is nervous about how I will react in that situation. The fact that she is nervous about what I'll do makes me feel terrible. I don't want her to have to worry about me. More than anything, I want her to be happy. I sometimes feel like I'm in the way of this. 

I have been tempted to act out due to everything that's been going on in my life. Most of the time I'm simply tempted to distance myself to see if she reaches out, but I have not done so. I have been trying to find the middle ground between being clingy and being distant; as I'm sure you all understand, not going to extremes is difficult for me. I've also been trying to make new friends where I live and hang out with other people so that I don't isolate myself or unload everything onto my girlfriend. 

TLDR; My girlfriend moved away and a lot of shit has been going on in my life and I have been very openly communicating with her about my fears and haven't acted out! ",BPD
"Help me get through this. My girlfriend and I have been together since July last year. We had an amazing time together. In February I had an episode and kicked her out. We got back together a couple weeks later. But I was distant. I treated her like shit. I had a health problem. I still treated her like shit I was in a funk. I couldn't get out of my head. I ghosted her for a couple weeks. We talked and hung out for a week. Then I ghosted her for a couple weeks again. I realized I needed her. This was in June. Months I put her through my bullshit. I thought we were working things out. Last night she broke up with me. I was devastated. I begged. I pleaded. She said I hurt her in so many ways for so long. She can't trust that I'm being genuine. 

I get a get text last night from my friend who saw her at a bar in my town. She lives 45 minutes away. She also told me she was going out of town to a city that's an hour and a half. My friend told me she saw her with another girl. Kissing and holding hands. 


I'm dying. I can't go through this. She was my rock. But this is what I deserve. I can't sleep. I have no appetite. And here I am having to take care of myself and my toddler. Please help me.

I'm the manager at a store, so it isn't as simple as just asking for a few personal days. Even though I'm full time I don't get any paid sick or vacation days and I need all the money I can get.

"possible trigger warning - but would like BPD's perspective! Please read if you can :) I know not all people with BPD are the same, we are all different. No one is perfect & we all have this one, precious life. To me, all life is precious.
So I don't mean to offend or upset anyone. Please read and if possible, I would like a person with BPD to give me their thoughts and perspective of it.
If you are on the Reddit BPD forums, then you are most certainly trying to actively help yourself to be a better person. Which I think is awesome :)
So it is not about you personally at all, many thanks in advance.

About ten years ago, I had a relationship with a woman who has BPD. She was so abusive and violent that it gave me trauma.
She could see it happening to me, but was unable to control herself. So she blamed my feelings saying I was too sensitive.

It really began when she had to take me to hospital, because of the first physical attack.
Then it all went roller coaster. I don't even understand why it happened, as I remember, I was just speechless..

The same weekend, I got this email:

My dear *******!

When I think of you as you might be confused and sad I feel very sad myself. I don't want to be cruel to you although I guess I already have been. What I said about you fucking the next person was mean and I wish I hadn't. And above that it implies that we are finished, that it's over.
But really I didn't make a decision like that at all and when you said that it's probably good that I make a decision I didn't reply to that because I felt empty with no feeling and energy left. The only thing I knew was to slip away that moment because I couldn't bare it no longer. I was trapped in myself and didn't know which way to turn.
******** I am aware that this email reaches you when it's probably too late. I can understand if you tried to get used to the idea that all is over. I'm sorry to disturb you again if thoughts kind of settled in you already. I don't mean to play you, I don't have a plan nor a clue, All I know is that I think that you are a great person that is kind, concerned, funny, very sensitive, that you are aiming to do the right thing and you are prepared to try out new ways. You are open, curious - alive. You are a beautiful man with a wonderful scent. You have opened yourself so much to me, you showed yourself vulnerable and not proud (in a negative sense).I thank you for all this and at the same time I'm sad and sorry that I do not seem to be able to handle it. I know very well that I ruined what we had by this stupid, stupid thing I did. And I know that I am twisted in my emotions, that I have problems with accepting love without suspicion. That I am paranoid that people try to manipulate me and that I havn't developed ways to deal with stress other than coldness and numbness of emotion. I'm so sorry that I make things so complicated, you deserve unconditional love, healthy love and healing love. I don't want to stress you even more, especially not on a Sunday night, I know you must be tired. I just want you to know that I respect you and in many ways you showed me how to be and handle things. I'm not saying I'm a good student but you planted ideas in me that I definitely  want to put into action.
Ok ********, whatever happens I hope you know that I'll go to any doctor with you you need, but of course I hope you don't need one.
I am so sorry to be responsible for sadness, gief and sorrow, disappointment and maybe hate.
I think of you all the time..
*******

Two weeks after this email, she smashed a door into my face. It knocked me out and when I woke, I found she was repeatedly slamming the door onto my head.
I staggered home & washed the blood from my mouth.
The apologies stopped coming by email, they were only whispered in my ear when no one else was about.
No doubt to prevent, possible, later incrimination.

Choking, shoving, kicking and punching all came next.

Eventually it was too much. I left & went no contact.
Then had six months or so PTSD. I was shaking like sh*t.

Then I forgave her. Because I didn't want to live my life being bitter either.

But just to make sure that I paid for my crimes of being a great person, showing kindness, concern and sensibility and of deserving love in lots of different healthy ways..
She started a smear campaign.. that I only just recently heard about (my no-contact was so good in fact) it was epic apparently and almost global thanks to the digital age.



I loved her! I never hit her back, I am not an abusive person, I learnt everything I could about BPD, I tried to support her, I took her to all her therapy sessions.
I even kept all the abuse secret for all these years.

What on earth is that about? Why would she do that? Isn't that a bit too much?

Apparently my all nice colleagues and bosses thought I was a violent stalker :O I only found out a few months ago. I'm still speechless & don't know whether to laugh or cry.

I was never back in her town since I left, not for a second. I never contacted her. I never searched after her. I never asked after her.
And I have never reacted to the smear, never tried to defend myself.. I have occasionally felt like confronting her. Whatever that means (email?) but honestly, I can't be bothered.
I really cared about her, yet she was soooo devious. Is it something worse than BPD?
I am not angry (all the time) about it, but it does annoy me that she needs to go to such lengths for attention.
Oh she is such a silly billy.. (not the actual words I would use)

any perspectives, anyone? (apart from my co-dependent enabling schmlabling, that was my life lesson, not.doing.it.again)

I am all fine and healed now, mentally and physically. I have a wonderful girlfriend now that I wouldn't have met if this hadn't have happened.
So I don't regret my experience but I don't entirely understand it either.
Perhaps I should just leave it at that, no more mulling over meaning and move on?

Comments greatly appreciated. Thanks again!

Big hugs & I wish you all a Happy New Year :-))))))))

"Second week into first full-time job. Can't stop crying. Hey - need to know if anyone else has felt this.

I've been freelancing for four years, mostly because I dig the one night stand feeling: by the time my clients realize I'm a worthless, talentless piece of shit, I'm already done.

I'm not worthless or talentless, I'm quite good at what I do. But I never work hard enough, my work is garbage, I don't know how to talk to clients, everyone hates me...you all get it.

Anyway, after six months with a certain client, they offered me a job as Creative Director. I love the team, I love the company, I ran into it with open arms.

The company raised their offer by 35% and double my stock options when I told them the salary didn't cover my cost of living. They gave me my own office so I could bring my dogs because the CEO and CTO are allergic. They gave me 5 days off in my first two weeks for my sister's wedding. Basically, they appreciate me - above and beyond.

And I can't stop crying.

I locked myself in my office yesterday and cried. I've been crying all day. I love my job, I love what I work on, and every tiny piece of not overwhelmingly positive feedback that I get sends me over the edge.

I'm so scared to fail, I'm so scared that I'm going to disappoint them, I'm terrified that I'll be fired and everyone will hate me and I'll be alone again.

It feels exactly like what happens every time I entertain a romantic relationship.

How do I stop myself from torpedoing my life?",BPD

"Need a bit of advice. Bf wants to move. Hello again, thought I would post here again as you guys have been extremely helpful and have offered great advice. 

My Bf hasn't had the best few weeks mentally as he's been suicidal, self harming, raging, went missing and we've been fighting a lot. I've been trying to learn more about BPD from external sources and from you guys but for all the patience I have and hope that he will eventually get the help he needs, he has none left. He's extremely disillusioned with the NHS (we live in London) having been in and out of various therapies since 19 and recently has been given the run around by them for weeks.  

After the day he went missing for a few hours (see post history for that), his dad's suggested to him that he moves up north to live with him as he's worried that he'll get like how he was at 19. I disagree with it as I don't think it will change anything properly whereas he says he could save money but no real mention of how he would get the help he needs.  I personally think that the money his dad would spend be better used towards private health help but I can't make that decision.

He says he's not sure if he'd go as he's still thinking about it but he won't/can't tell me a time frame and said I should have been saving anyway incase of things like this. He says he'd make sure I'm okay if he leaves but I'm stuck in a limbo where I can't really plan for the future since I might have to move elsewhere in a few months. I made an offhand comment about buying a fan for the flat in summer and he shut it down saying we might not be here in a few months.

Am I wrong for feeling like this isn't fair to me? Or for feeling like he's looking at this as a black and white situation and running away as well?  I have my own issues with depression and anxiety that I'm working on but this not knowing just keeps making me more and more upset.  He's meeting his dad this week so maybe I might know.

I was reading that many people who have BPD also have addictions to alcohol, cocaine, and opiates. I, personally, am aware that alcohol and coke are weaknesses for me. 

My question is: do you find alcohol / drugs help relieve your BPD symptoms (aka giving no fucks), or do you find that they exacerbate your BPD? 

I find that I walk a very tight rope between both options. And I'm pretty sure that if I want a full recovery (or the closest I can find to it), then I should probably be sober...?

"Feelings of Extreme Guilt Sorry if this is a bit scattered or not well written, just trying to put this out there—

Kind of just venting, but also looking to hear others' experiences with this. One of my main issues/flaws has always been feeling very guilty, about everything, in every situation, all the time. Whether it's in a relationship, in my family, or even in my relationship with my self, I always feel guilty and undeserving of whatever I'm given, or whatever I need. This is often compounded by and extremely conflicting with my eating disorder, as it usually leads to my feeling like a very wasteful person (whether it's from restricting and letting food go bad or purging what I'd just eaten). Today I had a very bad ED day and the feelings of wastefulness (which are admittedly valid) and guilt over how I treat myself are just too much. I'm not sure I've ever known how to properly address this very deeply ingrained sense of not deserving compassion or care... I feel that for many years I just covered it up or denied the feeling altogether but lately it's become to much to handle. 

I guess my question is, barring some intense therapy, what has helped some of you deal with not having a sense of self worth? I have a few trusted friends to whom I can talk if absolutely necessary (i.e. considering hurting myself or just feeling completely hopeless), but I'm looking to find something more constructive and helpful in the long run.

"Horrified that they'll leave... I've been diagnosed as Bipolar II, but I'm pretty sure I'm misdiagnosed. I'm absolutely certain, to the core of my being, that I have BPD. The point of this post isn't to find a diagnosis, but to talk about how BPD affects those closest to us and our relationships with them.

I've been best friends with my now boyfriend for over 12 years. We've been officially dating for 3 of them. He understands me more than anyone I've ever dated, mostly because he has debilitating anxiety and depression issues too, but also because he's gone out of his way to do research and actually study BPD (alongside my other issues, such as PTSD and OCPD) to really ""get"" what's going on with me, as to why I 'pick fights' over menial issues, get overly stressed when I'm about to take any sort of trip, etc.

The problem I'm having right now is that I'm absolutely fucking terrified that eventually, one day, my bf will have enough of my shit and get to packing. Knowing deep down in my heart that he's in it for the long haul, I don't *realistically* think it will happen, but it drives me absolutely insane, to the point of keeping me up at night, that he may eventually get tired of my shit and leave me for someone ""not as crazy."" I'm not a natural ""crier"" by nature, but in my episodes, I get super clingy and sob uncontrollably, and lash out when he gets even the slightest bit frustrated with me. Then I get frustrated with myself because I hate that I'm acting the way I am, and it makes me want to resort to old destructive coping mechanisms like cutting. 

I fucking hate this... I hate constantly feeling like I'm in a whirlwind in my own brain. I hate not speaking to my mother because she doesn't understand mental illness whatsoever, so I don't let her into my life any deeper than talking about the weather. I hate not talking to my father because, even though he's the second closest person to me, I don't want to worry him with the storm constantly brewing within me. I hate keeping *me* to myself because I want friends so badly that I don't want to scare anyone off. I hate that every single fucking day I come home from work and watch youtube and drink because even the thought of associating with other people is mentally exhausting. I hate that I spend all my free time on a couch watching infomercials until 4 in the morning because I'm terrified to go to my bedroom, knowing the nightmares that await me when I do. I feel like a god damn zombie, utilizing all my spoons just to go to work and be a functional fucking adult, then be pacified all night just to distract me from myself. 

How does anyone find their way out of this? Where do I go from here? What do I do? I've tried counseling but I can never stick with it... I'm stuck. I feel like a mouse in a glue trap... so desperate to live that I'm willing to chew my own limbs off for a chance at freedom...",BPD
"Do any of you love the show Intervention? Whenever I find myself having an episode, I turn to Intervention for some strange reason. I love to hear about people's lives and see how others suffer from their Addis films. 

It always inspires me that no matter how far someone has fallen, there is always a support system who cares for them and wants them to get better. I guess I wish that I could feel that same type of support in my life. 

It's a bit strange but my therapist who told me she suffers from BPD as well tells me she completely gets why I watch it. ",BPD
"Too depressed to work. Husband says money comes first. I cannot hold a job due to my illness. Because I have worked in the past I cannot get disability. I have had 35 jobs. I flip out or self destruct after a few months, due to my illness. I recently had a job for five weeks. We were great financially. I flipped out on my boss, screamed and cussed at him, very ugly. Was so ashamed, I quit the next day. Started treatment, again, have decided to go for inpatient after Halloween if I'm still suicidal. Husband requires that I work because he does not want to pay for Xmas or thanksgiving by himself again. Last year it was all on him because I was in psych hospital.

"Long, angry rant. Please tell me I'm wrong. (Maybe TW) Was supposed to get my car looked at. Was going to dropped it off at my mechanic, about 20 min drive one way. Had planned on being at a library in the area for some research I was doing. Planned to have an acquaintance pick me up, take me home, and even was nice enough to take me to work and pick me up tomorrow. He knew about it. We planned it in advanced. 

So I'm driving home from work and BOOM traffic. I usually don't hit traffic because of the way I go home. But a power line had gone down and they shut down part of the main drag I take to get home. So all traffic was diverted, took about 30 minutes to the usual 5 it takes me to get to the highway. I was also backed up (in the dietary sense) and had been trying to go all day, so my stomach was hurting. So as I'm leaving work my acquaintance texts me and asks if i can drop my car off right now. I said no, we agreed on a time and I had some errands to run. He said it was ok, but our original planned time might be a bit later. I asked him why. He asked if it mattered why (??). I said yes, because i had chosen the time frame for a reason (need to get home and go to sleep). So he told me he was going to have his daughter and his mom was going to be in town. 

1. He tells me he is not in contact with his mom, so I'm not sure how that would affect anything but I guess I am ignorant on his relationship with her. 2. If him having his daughter would affect it, he should've told me.. we planned this early last week.

So he then says 'is that acceptable?' And I said 'yeah I'm just starting to loathe my friends with kids.' Meant as a joke. I understand kids are a lot, I don't have them, and rightly so. But it does frustrate me that my only close friends have kids and things come up which ruin plans. So he responds to my message saying 'ok, forget it, sorry I asked.'

Then apparently blocked me. So I texted him and said it was just a joke, I get stuff with kids comes up. And then again to ask if he could let me know when he's left. But at this point, I was not aware he'd blocked me, he isn't very prompt with texting usually. So getting home late put a damper on my plans to go to the library since I also had to cook and clean when I got home. 

I ended up just going to the car place from my apartment. I get there. Texted him when I was on my way. Called when I was there, it rang once, went to voicemail. Okay, figured he was just busy. Called again, same thing. Now, I've known him for a while. I know he used to block me over small things. Turns out, he still blocks over small things. It clicked in my head and decided to get on Facebook to see if he'd blocked me there. Turns out, he did!

And then I got so angry. I drove home angry. My left arm started hurting. I got dizzy. I was ENRAGED. And I tried to calm down. I don't honestly remember the drive home and it was only 20 minutes ago. 

I got home and decided I would contact him and say what I needed to say. 

Because the fucked up bit of all of it, I was going to confess my feelings for him when he picked me up. Obviously, if his daughter wasn't with him. 

But now, here I am. I feel so much anger at myself and him. It's overwhelming. I feel disgusting. And disgusted.",BPD
"let's talk: the lonely life, safe behind a social barrier A couple months back I became a lot more introverted after cutting some people off. Majority of my remaining relationships dissolved after I moved across the country. It was lonely at first but I got used to it. I'm kinda afraid of having friendships since it's easy for me to become emotionally dependent. The few friendships I've made or continued I keep at a distance. This past week I got incredibly depressed and my way of thinking has been shifted. As a result, I've finally become comfortable with, I've accepted loneliness. So how do I approach relationships ? I'm not sure. What are your thoughts and personal experiences?

Honestly, as of now I want to continue being who I am and doing what I want (sure life is pointless but I can't kms, I've thought about, craved it, but it'd be too inconvenient and hurtful to my family + Positivity disgusts me, it feels like a lie and I feel like everything that conventionally gives most people a meaning for life- family, friends, career, talent, etc.- isn't enough for me) so yeah I've been taking it day by day, i don't expect to be happy, I don't expect people to make me happy, and as a result I can just BE. lf people enter the happenings of my life, they're welcome to join. But I will not seek it out.Let's see how long this lasts haha. 

That being said, it's weird for me to talk to people. I talk to friends and I feel like I'm sharing and contributing in a socially acceptable manner. But afterwards I'm back to feeling like I shouldn't have talked so much, shared this or that, guess I'm going back to wanting validation.
For me, it's shameful. I'm ashamed to want validation. If I am validated, I convince myself it's a lie, they don't know me. 
I do that a lot more lately, lie to myself, emotionally lie to others. Everyone does it, just on a different level, different awarenesses to it. Before, I was desperate for someone to understand, someone to listen and validate my traumas, my troubles. Never was I fully pleased. The times I was, ended in the realization that we/I fictionalize comfort in order to live with our situation. I will always be alone. God, I hate to sound pessimistic, but the point is, when somebody asks how I am, I just save everyone's time and energy if I smile and say I'm fine, never been better. Is this ok? Have y'all had similar experiences? 
I'm safe behind this barrier I've created.",BPD
"Favourite person doesn't think about the consequences of their actions and it's going to kill me I'm not sure if anyone else is in a similar situation but my favourite person does really horrible things and never thinks about how it can affect me. 

I try to hide the fact that everything he does affects me so easily but he will promise that we will spend the night together and then go out with friends instead (onthe rare occasion we might get time together) This keeps happening again and again and I feel like it's the worst betrayal I can experience. 

Why would someone say they'll be with you and then leave you for something they see as a better plan? I don't know how I'm supposed to cope with someone who understands my BPD but is still happy to hurt me in this way. I can't handle being lied to. It's like they're playing games, trying to push me away. 

I feel triggered so badly by being treated like this and feel so ready to act out by self harming or doing something more dangerous. I feel like I can't control it and it's so horrible. Why would someone lie and do things like this whilst knowing that they are able to affect you like this? 


I feel like I'm going crazy and they are the only person that could calm me. They only have to be honest and they can't even do that. What can I do? They already know exactly how I feel and say sorry repeatedly, but don't mean it as keep repeating same things :( ",BPD

"Anyone wanna keep daily logs together Kinda having a hard time doing this alone and it'd be nice to find someone that's wanting to keep in touch daily. The BPD community is awesome and keeping working together sounds awesome. Little background. I'm 25 and come from a long background of Mental Health issues but I'm the only one that accepts and tries to work on mine so I don't go down the same path as those for mentioned. But I also have issues of my own since I also struggle with PTSD and Bi-Polar. I've struggled with drug addiction and poor impulse control as well as anger issues all of which I've improved so much in the last two months. But I find loneliness to be a sore spot now.

When I was younger I was pretty popular so people were interchangeable to me so I kept a lot of people on rotation so I never had to feel abandoned or alone but I've burnt every bridge in the past due to not staying in touch or letting my drugs come first. 2017 was the worst year of my life. I'm surprised I even made it out alive. I had delusions and hallucinations as well as crazy dissociations so bad I performed a sit down hanging only for the purpose to choke myself out of anger but being in control enough to let off. Eventually the plan was to choke myself so hard out of anger that I'd pass out and let nature do the rest. But that didn't happen now did it ;)

I'm now in recovery and keeping daily logs as well as daily tasks to keep myself busy and active. I'm back on my meds and holding myself responsible and accountable for my actions. I work out daily and also find free time to play some Vidder Games :) 

Anyways I was hoping someone out there wanted to keep in contact and maybe go through this together. Either way I hope all of you are doing well and stay strong :) <3",BPD
"i'm so tired of coming off in ways i don't intend to because of my illness. it feels like no matter how i act, most people don't like me because i always come off as ""too much"" of something.
when i meet new people, i am too enthusiastic and hyper and they think i'm annoying and exhausting to be around. if i try to be chill to avoid this, i will barely talk at all and then people think i'm rude and snobby.
i went to dinner with a friend and a group of his friends (my first time meeting them) and i got so stressed and overwhelmed by meeting so many new people at once that i literally just sort of dissociated the whole time and didn't talk to anyone or anything at all. my friend just texted me asking why i was so ""abrasive to everyone"" that night.
i wasn't trying to be abrasive, whatever he means by that. i was nervous and stressed. i told him that, but i can't stand that all these new people think i'm a bitch now.

"I fucking fucked up. [WARNING: Possible substance abuse trigger]







Important Background: FP is new like a week or so new. Him and his girlfriend are in an open relationship, but only on her end because she had this disorder that starts with an N that makes ppl addicted to sex. She also just so happens to have BPD, which made FP and even bigger FP because that means he better understands how I and my emotions work. 

How I fucked up: Me( M20) just started talking to this guy recently and he became my FP so fucking fast it basicslly gave me whiplash. He's (m18), lives on campus with me, which is great because it would be easy for us to hang out, and he's bi. I invited him over last night to drink and we mixed alcohol and Xanax and fucking weed too, which I had never done. It was great although I don't recommend it.

We had a good night and a good time, but the next day we find out we had kissed each other (not intentionally but we were cross-faded) and SC'd it to some of his friends. He told his girlfriend because he's a decent guy, she understably was pissed, and I lost my FP. He told me he wasn't mad and it wasn't my fault, but that we can't hang out anymore. I literally feel like dying right now. I've just layed in bed all day trying to pretend I don't exist. 

So him and his girlfriend show up to get a few of the things he left this morning, and it was like having to say goodbye to him. The dissociation was so real I guess because I couldn't handle it, and his girlfriend just stood there like she wanted me dead, and tbh so did I.

I'm really sorry FP's girlfriend.",BPD
"Completely destroying my relationship with SO of over 3 years I love him, with all my heart. My my BPD is making me crazy and I act and say things that hurt him so much. Don't get me wrong, I doubt it's all down to my BPD that makes me feel this way but it certainly is the main culprit. 

How can I mange my relationship better? I feel uncontrollably  hurt when he says he doesn't want to see me because he needs some time alone. I feel uncontrollably hurt when he says he doesn't want to live with me (but does at some point, just doesn't know when). And I know realistically that he is completely entitled to time alone, but in the moment it hurts me so much. My brain tells me that he's fed up with me, that he doesn't love me, that he's going to break up with me. I miss him so much, it's not like we see each other everyday but I know he loves me (BPD tells me otherwise). I just don't know how to get round this.

So I got him to drop me off, I told him goodbye and I left. Later on he apparently came to my house and was shouting for me but I didn't hear. Today he messaged me and told me I was evil. I said I didn't want to hurt him and argue anymore so I thought it was best if I just go.

Yes, that's it.

I decided to try filling the hole inside of me with people in different countries. Completely online relationships hoping I wouldn't get attached and fuck it up. Hoping it would be a poor enough imitation of a relationship it could satisfy the loneliness but not be significant enough to hurt when it ended. I knew it was temporary, and yes I did care about this guy, it wasn't me not caring, I truly want what's best for him.

I realise now. I just can't handle relationships. I cannot handle the inevitable fight, argument or breakup.

I can't cope. Please someone just help me, because I'm so god damn upset. I can't talk to him because it's unfair to burden him with my shit. I can't talk to any of my usual friends because it's so insane. The only person I could speak to is my sister and she's blanking my calls.

"Obsessing over a new guy. Need to understand if this is just BPD The situation is that I have broken up with my boyfriend of two and a half years last month. Since then we have been trying to be friends But it's been difficult. So we are currently in the gray zone for now. 

Ever since I broke up with him I have been trying to learn to be myself again as for a long time I have been trying to change to fit my partner. But in a moment of weakness I downloaded a dating app and even though I ignored pretty much everyone I did notice one guy. We started talking and realised we have so much in common. 

I did realise that maybe I'm being unhealthy just focusing on a different guy again so after about a week of chatting online I told the new guy (let's call him Anthony) that I need to focus on myself and I'm dealing with a lot of things so I won't be talking to him anymore. He was super understanding and even mentioned he went through a phase where he had to find himself too. He said I should call him when I feel better. So I kept his number and it's only been a couple of days but I keep imagining these stupid scenarios where I get better soon and meet him and it's all nice and lovely. Now I know this is bullshit and I barely know Anthony but it makes me wonder if there's actually something there or if I'm just obsessing because of my BPD. 

I would like to contact him again if I feel better after a while but I'm worried that I'm not actually helping myself because I keep thinking about him and focusing on the things we have in common.

Any opinions welcome. I know that maybe I'm just imagining something that's not there but he seems like a really nice guy. Nicer than most men I have dated. And we seem to be quite similar. I don't know. Am I just being stupid?",BPD

"Does being gaslighted affect you more than the average person? When I am gaslighted it makes me question my reality, which a lot of people with BPD do daily because of their loss of a core sense of who they are. This also triggers me to think in EXTREME black and white and cannot be convinced into rationality until hours later or if someone forces me to step back. Family members who have gaslighted me I have absolutely split on. While this makes me feel horrible, gaslighting in the first place affects me so quickly without even me realizing what is going on.

**The situation**: My girlfriend gave this roommate some advice about something minor, and my roommate blew up at her. When she didn't tolerate that, he told her that he felt attacked and uncomfortable. In short, he blamed her for the reaction that he caused. This is the second time that he's disrespected her, and this time it was in public. I need to address this with him, because it's unacceptable behavior.

I was thinking about it just now, when he had me play a video game with him and since it's hard for me to understand it, I go mute and get depressed when I'm failing. I go mute because I don't want to let my anger out on him.

But just like my caregiver used to do to me... In the end, my brain is telling me he should hit me and beat me until I'm incapacitated. Tied up with tape (this was a situation that happened when I was a lot younger) and beaten... it's so awful but I have such a need for it in order to be comfortable.

It's been 2 months since we last made out but I think about him every fucking day.

It leads me to drinking daily and having unsafe casual sex to forget about my feelings towards him, but you know, it doesn't work that way. I feel trashy and I want to stop and I can't.

"How to get through phase in a romantic relationship where you feel suffocated and want to escape but literally have zero reason for feeling that way? You know that feeling?  When you just want to run away because you're suffocating?

Three years we've been together and this urge just came out of nowhere.  It's happened before and I really did try to sabotage the relationship, did a lot of emotional damage, took a while to heal.  It's happened in other relationships and I did end things.   Three years - this is the longest I've ever been in a non-volatile relationship.  I'm 31. I don't want the relationship to end!

Need to make a phone call to schedule an appointment? 

Me to me: just pick up the phone and do it.

Brain: nah, let's hit the snooze on that.

M2M: seriously, people do it all the time. 

B: no, I don't want to talk to the people on the phone. They might not think I'm an adult enough adult. 

M2M: that's their job. They really don't care if you make your appointment or not. 

B: we will be okay without for a little longer. Procrastinate and worry about it at the same time like we always do. 

TIME PASSES

Got the script, just need to turn it in on the way home.

M2M: it's not that hard, just dip into the parking lot, it's on the corner you turn at anyway. You can even go through the drive through for minimal interaction. 

B: hey, let's turn early here and take this alternative route home, a change of scenery will be fun. 

M2M: we have done this before, it literally has no benefit to wait in this simple task. We need this stuff. 

B: but how much? 

LATER AGAIN

Finally turn it in only for it to still be early, because laws on the medicine. They say to call back on a certain day to fill it. NBD. 

DAY COMES

M2M: okay, it's time now. Just make the call. Super simple. Then pick up on the way home. 

B: ummmm, can't we just go to the store? You know I hate the phone. What is it's the wrong number? What if I mess everything up? 

M2M: this will save time, just do it.

B: m'kay, but later....

MUCH LATER

Driving to the store to request the script in person. It will be ready the next day...

ACTUALLY STOPPED ON THE WAY HOME!!! Gold star for doing what needs to be done! Aaaaand one of the scripts was written wrong and I didn't double check. It was supposed to be a 90 day supply, but the doctor wrote it as 60. Insurance only covers 90 or 30 day quantities. Pharmacy filled it as 30 since they can't call on this type of script. 

M2M: *sigh* we need to make a new appointment closer now since we need to be there in person to get a refill...

B: but do we? 

M2M: yes. 

B: don't want to. No real reason. Let's just chalk it up to this being an inconvenience. 

M2M: we need to call sooner than later to ensure an appointment is available in time. 

B: that's an extra $45 copay. I hate it. Let's stop. 

M2M: not that trick again. This is happening. 

B: maybe... But you know we are going to wait until the last second. Enjoy the anxiety about it until then.

"I have next to no friends. I want friends to go out and do stuff with so bad it makes me cry Sorry I wasn't sure where to put this.

I've slowly come to a realization after not being a depressed pile of shit 24/7 that I'm an extrovert with the issue of having no social skills and having anxiety. Its fucking killing me.

I desperately want to go out, have a good time, the like, but I have like 2 friends and I can't ask to hang out with them all the time cause they have their own lives.

Through university my depression got so severe I lost the chance to make friends. I've never had a job where I could make friends either. I go to grad school this coming September but it's so intensive that I probably won't even have TIME to socialize.

I'm freaking 23 and I lost all opportunities to make friends and it's killing me. I just want to go out and enjoy myself. Improve my social skills. Make friends. Etc. There is literally nothing.

My moved back to my hometown for the summer away from the big city. There are no events for people with similar interests here. It's unsafe for me to do anything night life on my own and even then im too self conscious to meet people (meeting is an issue but once I get talking and stuff it's great). In addition, most people who are out at bars or clubs already have a social circle or are there to get laid.

I had half the town worried about me yesterday due to my Facebook posts throughout the night. An old friend who left me when I moved back to my hometown, texted asking if she needed to come over. She's a life saver. She found a mental health day program 9-2pm about 20 minutes from here where she lives. They provide free transport. She even checked if they'd take my insurance. She came and told me and asked if I wanted to try it. I said yes, so she set up a consult on Wednesday.

"How to Deal When Eoommate Splits Black on You? Advice Please!! My housemate has BPD and he has for sure split black on me. I don't know what to do but I've just been hiding from him. It's been about two weeks and I don't go into the living room. 

He gets extremely angry at me about very small things and ignores it when I do things like clean the whole house or do nice things for him. He is constantly passive aggressive and using a harsh tone even when I'm offering him gifts or to help him. 

He screams at me, interrupts me, insults me, makes assumptions about my feelings, etc and constantly talks shit about me to our other housemate. Everything in the world is my fault now, even things that happened in his life months ago. I'm not sure how much more I can take and I don't know what to do. I've been avoiding being at home, he just makes me feel so bad about myself and every time we speak he insults me to my core. He says I'm manipulative, egocentric, unempathetic, etc. because I try not to play into his life. He has made it his mission to make me into a monster and it's working, he makes me feel so bad about myself for things I know aren't genuine just because he's so passionate about them. 

The big screaming episodes always follow a perceived rejection from me like me not willing to cancel on somebody else to do something with him or me being around a girl I'm casually sleeping with (who he demonizes).

"Broke no contact with ex/fp, asked him to talk once a week, now regretting that too Very long story short, he broke up with me due to compassion fatigue, told me he hopes to get back together one day, then slept with *the* ex he knew I was paranoid about soon after. He was mean about it at first (defensive) but he eventually apologized to both of us.

I tried remaining friends with him but I couldn't do it. I decided to go no contact (not on a whim, I was thinking about it even before this happened for my own good) and he hated it.

But it felt like I was getting significantly worse. I felt like I was splitting on an extreme level. After 2 weeks I gave in and contacted him. He was pissed at me for ""leaving"", and I apologized like a dumbass (even though I think setting that boundary was my right), and asked to maybe talk once a week or so.

Now I'm regretting *that*. Talking to him makes me realize my anger is justified, but he's actually caring and learns from mistakes. But when we're not talking, my brain thinks he's the most hurtful person I know, like right now. It makes me want to run far far away from him.

So I've been staying at my mom's place for like two weeks now(I usually live on my own). She works night shifts, which means that she'll be away like two or three nights and then she's usually off work for quite long stretches, sometimes up to ten consecutive days.

She's just had one of those ""off-duty episodes"" and has been at home for... A week, I think. Now, here's the issue: While I intuitively, *and rationally*, feel kind of ""Uggghh..."" around her because she's very emotionally different from me and also one of the very reasons I developed BPD in the first place – lots of invalidation, ignoring, criticism, and so on. 

The thing is that I've learned how to cope with her while also taking care of myself, so while I certainly have this constant inner monologue about my resentment towards her, I can manage it and at the same time respect my boundaries. 

Anyway, since I have been feeling/thinking very ""critically"" about her lately, this morning when I went to therapy, I was like ""YEEEES!!! FINALLY SHE'LL BE WORKING TONIGHT AND I HAVE SOME SPAAAAACEEE!!!!"". But now that I came home and she's already gone, I feel... Confused. 

Like, I don't feel like I want *her specifically* to be here maybe, but I just feel very odd when I go from being surrounded by people and participating in a social context(being around her in general, and today I also had DBT group) to being alone, I just feel... Some kind of bottomless hopelessness. It's like when I go from active participation to having to take action initiatives by myself, I just... freeze. I lose all my abilities to ""keep going"" in any way at all. My thoughts clutter up completely and whenever I try to ground myself to sort them out, all that is left is a hole of sadness which is equally as bothersome for me.",BPD
"Some symptoms of BPD explained (Part 1) Some symptoms of BPD explained Part 1

This post is about BPD as it is a set of symptoms and coping strategies for childhood attachment trauma.  If you do not have a history of childhood attachment trauma, this may not pertain to you.  I write this based off what I know and my own experience.

Symptoms:

Emotional dysregulation – the unmodulated anger, the bouts of depression, and the numbness are all symptoms of emotional dysregulation, which is often caused by childhood trauma (like abuse or neglect) for those with or without bpd.  Hypervigilance is the nervous system constantly being on high-alert – subjectively, hypervigilance feels like a constant state of agitation, anxiety, and/or anger.  When people describe just feeling angry all the time for no reason, in the case of early trauma this is a subjective experience of hypervigilance caused by such early traumas that dysregulated the system. 
The numbing feeling of feeling nothing happens when the nervous system, on too high of alert all the time, shuts down a bit too compensate because it cannot regulate any other way.

Trauma reenactment patterns – the unhealthy behaviors, often harmful, that people engage in to avoid abandonment. DBT tries to change these behaviors as they are actively problematic in improving the emotional dysregulation plus they are often harmful to self or others.

Dissociation – the constant daydreaming, the getting lost in fantasies, the feeling that one is not a real person, the feeling of walking in a dream or the world or oneself being real. This is a coping strategy for emotional dysregulation – absent an ability to modulate emotions, the brain disconnects from feeling the body.  

Shame & self-hatred – in the case of childhood trauma, the shame is a primal neural mechanism to impede upon a child's attempts to fight, flee, or connect with volatile, potentially dangerous caregivers.  Volatile and unpredictable caregivers scare children's brains into thinking they are potentially dangerous, but children cannot effectively fight an adult or outrun an adult (especially a caregiver that they need for physical and social survival and development) nor can they completely avoid connection.  The amygdala (fight-flight detector) is often on high-alert around volatile caregivers, but such constant stress is wearing on the body and brain.  So what the brain does is to divert efforts to a shame response that recruits networks to encourage hiding and avoidance.  This happens in the more primal, lower parts of the brain.  This shame is easily triggered in adulthood because it happens beneath the higher processing centers of the brain and is immediately triggered by even the slightest glances or tonal changes in voice. 

Notes:

Besides DBT and other talk or mindfulness based therapies to alter behaviors or increase self-awareness, one of the key core problems to the aforementioned symptoms is a lack of the brain regulating the body.  This is due to prolonged early trauma where the underdeveloped brain could not regulate the degree of stress it experienced; in an ideal childhood environment caregivers sufficiently help regulate children's nervous systems because the children's brains cannot do it on their own.  If the child does not receive adequate regulation from outside sources, and/or experiences too extreme of stress (a variable that varies widely amongst different kids) then the brain dissociates and over time, falls into the pattern of dissociating rather than learning to regulate the nervous system.

In this case of a dysregulated nervous system, thought are not the cause of the dysregulation, rather, the dysregulation prompts the thoughts.  When it comes to childhood trauma, thoughts are the byproduct of a dysregulated and traumatized nervous system; they are not the cause of the distress. 

In the case of shame – the self-loathing thoughts do not cause the shame; the shame is already there and has been for a long time.  It is the emotion of shame that prompts the self-loathing thoughts.  

I see many posts on here where people get caught up in their thinking – blaming their thoughts for causing their distress and trying to change their thoughts to alleviate the distress.  In the case of early childhood attachment trauma, the thoughts are byproducts produced by the emotional dysregulation and shame.  It is known that the left hemisphere attempts to explain internal emotions to itself; but in the case of trauma, the left hemisphere was dissociated from the traumatic emotions during the time the trauma occurred.  Because the left hemisphere was not developed yet in childhood, it did not process the emotions stemming from the traumatic material. As such, when those traumatic emotions (like shame) are triggered, the left hemisphere, the part of the brain responsible for explaining internal emotional reactions, is unable to accurately explain the cause of the triggered emotions.  What it does then, is to make stuff up.  It says things like ""I suck, I'm awful, I'm just terrible, I'm horrible, etc…."" because that is all the left hemisphere is able to come up with to explain this deep primal pervasive feeling of shame, as it was too underdeveloped and dissociated to process and encode the real reasons for the shame.

Thoughts are often blamed for the distress and people attempt to change the thoughts to make the feelings feel better.  If mindfulness/CBT is used in this manner, this is a misguided distraction.  It is also a way of reinforcing the very problem of dissociation and dysregulation that is a core issue with bpd.  People with a history of childhood attachment trauma are in a habit of staying in their head and out of their body; their brain now naturally gets absorbed in thought as a means to dissociate from the overwhelming feelings in the body.  Ruminating, catastrophizing, and trying to manipulate thoughts are all ways to reinforce staying in one's head and avoiding the feelings in the body.  But the way to decrease emotional dysregulation is to focus on the body and retrain the brain to focus on the body rather than to keep focused on thoughts.

"Being supportive and autosacrifice I've been noticing recently that it's hard for me being supportive to my boyfriend because I kinda feel like when he's feeling sad then I can't feel sad or something?? Or like he is ignoring me by having his own feelings?? Or even that I don't think he has it so hard because he doesn't have BPD or anything? 

Idk, it's not logical. I think the main reason is that a few years ago my mother had really severe depression and I basically ruined what mental health I had left to take care of her. Since then, it's been really hard to learn to put myself first, and I still don't always do it, so when someone is kinda needing me I'm like ""oh no, not this again"". 

Also, my therapist said that it could be a kind of splitting or black/white thinking. I mean, because of our lack of identity, we are very prone to comparing ourselves. So when someone else is feeling bad, I'll compare it to my own feelings, and since I have a tendency to autosacrifice, I'll just ignore mine even though they are probably worse. Also also, it's really hard for me to understand and communicate my feelings in the first place, so the other person might not even be aware. ",BPD
"Did anyone else used to be a completely, unforgivably shit person? How did you manage to change things? \*\*tldr: was a shitty person up until last year, had a profound identity crisis which somehow allowed me to rebuild my psychology and i gained access to empathy that I never knew I had\*\*   


Was anyone else a shit person before figuring out what was wrong and fixing it? 

Warning: Wall of text that will bore you to death.

I'm 18, I'm just coming up at the end of this 6 month process, one where I've painfully gone through every negative action in my life and realised the gravity of it. Dissecting my own brain. Trying to apologise to everyone I can. It's not something that I consciously decided to do, I had no choice. I was plunged into this void because of my mistakes and bad choices and it has forced me to look who I am straight in the face. It's changed everything for me.

Most people have done a few selfish things in their life. Most people have hurt someone else. But does anyone out there on reddit have their whole childhood and teenhood plagued by the fact that they were an insufferable prick? 

I can't even believe it. It feels like a different person yet I know I was in control of myself and could've made better choices. I was manipulative. I fucked people over left and right. I was so desperate for love and affection yet lied to the caring and genuine people who were there for me, the ones who actually loved me. None of them talk to me anymore.

I guess it's a combination of so many things. Selfishness. A combination of 0 self worth \(""how the hell could anyone care about me??""\) PLUS heaps of narcissism! \(thinking that you could do no wrong\). 

I don't ever want to go back to the mindset I used to have.

So that's why it's been sobering to have all these real emotions come crashing, 18 years too late, but honestly at the perfect time. And it's beautiful. But it's really a horrifying thing to have dawn on you. 

I treated my parents like \*\*shit\*\*

growing up. They worked so hard. 

When I became depressed and couldn't find a way out, my dad tirelessly drove me to therapy for and wards for years, dealt with my moods and panic attacks.

The more shitty things I did, the lower my self worth plummeted. In early middle school I had a huge conversation with my Jehovas Witness friend where I basically shat all over her religion. This wasn't very long after someone close to her died. I literally didn't think there was anything wrong with it until at least a couple weeks later. What the fuck?  

I used to be as edgy as humanly possible. It gave me a rush. I used to openly swear, say the N word all. the. fucking. time. Somehow no one really called me out on it. \(I guess it's a less shocking word in Australian middle school\).

In high school I was in a constant state of flipping between huge existentialism and huge nihilism, making me feel like an insane sociopath on the inside. That, plus the fact that I was able to come off as a funny and nice guy, made me think I was a full blown sociopath. 

I had insatiable hormones and became a classic fuckboy. I wanted to be some sort of desirable high school Chad but in reality I was probably creepy as fuck, and would start and end relationships willy nilly, and I really really hurt some people doing that. People cared about me and I always broke their hearts. I cheated and lied. I told people I was exclusive while I would chat someone else up at the same time. It all unravelled and came out in the end.

All through this, I'd steal money from my parents for drugs and alcohol \(luckily I never went too far down that route \- extremely addictive personality\). I kept taking LSD and having bad trips and freaking out my dad. I called ambulances to the household because I thought I was dying. The bill was huge.

\-\-\-\-

What's bizarre \(and kinda pathetic\) is that the catalyst to all this realisation wasn't any of the fallout from that. It was seeing my dad one day and thinking ""Jesus he looks really old right now"" \(he's only in his 50s\). 

And then I realised: Stress causes faster aging. 

I cause my dad \*\*\*fucktons\*\*\* of stress. I can't believe the rollercoaster I put my parents through. He felt the entire time that he wasn't being a good enough father, and he stressed so hard trying to come to terms with the fact that my mental illness wasn't getting better, it was getting worse. All he wanted to do was cure my depression somehow. I couldn't accept his love. I was only frustrated by the fact that he loved me.   
He looks like he could be well over 75 now. His hair fell out. He lost weight.   


That realisation let to other realisations. Going from event to event, realising how fucking pathetic and low I was in each one. I was always in the wrong. Massive identity crisis. Who the fuck am I?  


I fell into complete darkness. I attempted to kill myself.  I had absolutely 0 will to live. I realised how cowardly that would be \(not saying suicide is cowardly but in my situation it was the most selfish and cowardly thing I could do\).   


So then I started from the bottom, slowly rebuilding with a new set of morals and a new view of the world. 

This 'ego death' and rebuilding lasted 6 months \(and will probably continue\) because I kept finding new things in my past to decipher, shit that I forgot I did. I'd scroll through old conversations and find that I was 10x more abrasive, offensive and shitty than I ever remembered. I'd try and apologise to people and they'd tell me that I hurt them much more than I ever thought, in turn rendering my apology completely weak. The guilt is crushing sometimes but it's important to turn it into something productive instead of laying in bed being destroyed by it. 

I don't have the highs and lows like I used to. Somehow life is pretty good right now. I've managed to stay stable for at least 2 months. This has literally never happened before. If something from the past comes back to bite me in the ass, then so be it. I deserve everything that happens to me. I accept that with open arms. 

But from this point onward, I'm not going to hurt a single soul until I die, never by choice, and never for selfish reasons. There's nothing in me that wants the shallow things that I used to want. The biggest pleasure is in being better than I used to be, and being good to those close to me, especially my parents. I'm forever indebted to them for those terrible adolescent years.

If being more stable and treating everyone better means withdrawing from society and having a much smaller amount of friends, so be it. I only have a couple of friends, most of them online, and I actually care about them so much now. Now their struggles can affect my emotions. I used to not give a shit. Now one of my closest friends is depressed and I feel obligated to be there for them. \*\*That's what any good friend would do.\*\* Yet only this year I'm doing it for the first time? With no ulterior motives? It's a really beautiful feeling to actually feel compassion. I guess you just need some sort of trigger to get the process started.   
All my life people tried to help me, and I wondered ""Why? what's in it for you?"". I realise now that's not a question most people have to ask themselves, many people are able to give without expecting something directly in return. I was never capable of thinking that way until now.

I've learned a lot of lessons from the people around me and from myself.   
If you got this far, thank you for reading.

"Is it possible to manage BPD on your own? I've been to several psychologists and I've never been satisfied with them. I did try somatic, DBT, CBT among other types of therapy but it just didn't really make much of a difference.

I have such a hard time being around people in social settings. I always mess things up somehow. I always feel like people will eventually hate and leave me. They always have in the past. I'm so tired of being lonely unable to truly and honestly connect with anyone. I feel so much nothing and everything. I feel like I'll never be the person I want to be, I feel like I'll never be hold up having friends let alone a relationship. I feel ugly and I'm not even sure why? I'm so self-conscious and insecure and no amount of weight loss makes a difference, there's always something that makes me feel like I'm ugly. I don't believe it when people compliment me, I feel like the only reason anyone would do that is to get something out me.

"Just diagnosed, trying to understand. Hello!

I was recently diagnosed with BPD and I'm trying really hard to come to terms with it. I've also been placed in a queue for DBT but from what I heard it seems to completely miss the mark for me. Although I admit that I've only heard my psychiatrist briefly explain it to me and some googling, no actual experience with it.

As for my story and what led me to be diagnosed.. It started a little more than a year ago when my mother got worried about my mental state(It was real bad at this point) after being isolated for about half a year. She convinced me to go see a doctor who I was completely honest with regarding suicidal thoughts and even eventual plans. He prescribed me like 100 pills of sertraline and told me to come back frequently for check-ups. It didn't take long until I took a huge overdose of sertraline and stayed up for 3 days straight until I got some form of short-lived mania(only lasted a few hours) and got put in the hospital.

After my first hospital visit they prescribed me more drugs which I overdosed on a few times until I eventually tried to hang myself and nearly succeeded. Then I was put in the same hospital again and after THAT visit they sent me to a specialized psychiatric treatment center(not sure if that's the right name, English isn't my native language). I met someone from the depression team who I told about a sexual assault I went through a year before and she promptly sent me to the PTSD team. I talked with the psychiatrist there and told her that I have had problems with self-harm/attempted suicide(mainly different ways of choking, no cutting) since I was 13/14 years old and that my mental state had a tendency of jojo-ing up and down. Some days I went from being happy and loving life to wanting to kill myself over the course of a few hours.

After a few months of seeing this psychiatrist she diagnosed me with BPD and queued me up for DBT with the personality disorder team at the same treatment center. However looking at the criteria for BPD I don't feel it reflects me at all past the self-harm and unstable mental state. And even then that unstable mental state isn't reactive, I'm usually not extremely affected by others actions but rather it kind of just does whatever it wants. One minute I'm happy and the next I'm suicidal. I don't have any unstable relationships since I don't really have any relationships at all and I have no issues with abandonment because I can't really get attached to people in the first place which my doctor argues is my way of avoiding abandonment. My impulsiveness only goes so far as that I'm bad with money, other than that I'm a very risk-free person.

Anyhow my goal with all of this is to gain more insight into how this illness(sorry if that's the wrong terminology) works on a day to day basis to help me understand and accept that I have BPD or help me move my treatment in a more productive direction.

Sorry for the long read, I tried to keep it short and to the point although I probably failed at that ;)
Thanks in advance for any answers!",BPD
"i want to be worse i told my fp i'm stopping all my medication because i'm afraid of recovery and i want to get bad again. he said i have a horrible attitude and i'm afraid he hates me because he's acting distant now. i keep apologizing and asking if i've done something wrong and he says it's fine. but it's obviously not fine. i asked him if i'm being irrational and he said i don't know.

"Aftermath of a breakup when you have BPD TW: Suicide/Self Harm



Things ended between us in March of this year. Afterwards I became suicidal, relapsed into self harm and picked up a coke habit. Since then I'm constantly ruminating over this person and our relationship. I had a suicide attempt in early October and spent a week in ICU and 5 weeks in a psych ward. I get panic attacks whenever I see them on social media (even though they are blocked, mutual friends still post). This happened today and I had to self harm to feel better. Is it normal for bpds to still be so fucking damaged from a breakup after all this time? Does it ever get better?

"SO using bpd as a way to invalidate my emotions Recently diagnosed and I'm not taking it so well. I had reservations about telling my SO, but I figured if we're in it for the long haul it's better to get it out in the open. He didnt react well at first and made it about himself / used it as a blanket to cover all the problems and arguments we have had. We discussed it, and I moved on.  

He's been doing a lot of research on the subject ""so he can figure out how to deal with me"" since he says hes had trouble with navigating my emotions.  Stings a little but makes sence. 

We had a small argument yesterday that turned into a huge blowout when he started taking that research and using it to invalidate my feelings (that I feel are real and justified). He started saying that I was forgetting about all the good things he does because of this one issue, but that's not the case, we were simply discussing how his actions hurt my feelings, but my feelings for him havent changed. I just wanted him to know    this thing bugged me so it could be avoided next time. 

How do I address this issue?  Or AM I overreacting?  I want to let him know that I'm still the same person, and just because he read that bpd can cause you to overreact and see people black and white, that doesnt mean I'm always going to do those things. That sometimes his actions and my feelings about those are still valid. 

Tldr; my SO is using my bpd as a way to invalidate my real feelings. ",BPD
"How do you tolerate intimacy with someone you love? This sh*t is so scary. I've been with my boyfriend for just over a year. I always kind of had one foot in one foot out because of his instability (anxiety & depression & money issues & drugs & alcohol). I hated it, but I think it provided me with a form of safety...like if I lost him I would be ok because he had so many issues anyway. 

He was gone for a month for work recently. During this time I just did my own thing, safe because we had distance. Now he's back, and things are going super well. We are cuddling, kissing, laughing, joking, spending time together, watching tv, cooking, dancing.........it's magical.

And this, this is fucking worse than when he's distant. This is so scary. I keep convincing myself he is flirting with his ex (they're friends and text sometimes but it's been years and he's reassured me in the past). I'm convinced that as soon as he has money again he'll be back to being shitty. Which as I said, is actually better....but not what I want. 

It's honestly so uncomfortable. When we were cuddling this morning I almost told him I couldn't be in a relationship. I considered going through his texts to see if he's flirting with his ex. Sometimes he puts me down jokingly (comments like *ooh boy*) at silly things I say, and it made me want to break up with him. He's having dinner with his out of town family tonight and didn't invite me so I decided it's because his ex is going....and so I sweetly and manipulatively asked him to send me a picture of the dinner party....(without telling him the real reason).

​

I think that in the past, this feeling is what made me pick fights. Needing to cause drama to distract me from this fucking horrible vulnerability. Taking control by getting angry. Taking part in a painful BUT predictable cycle. Right now  I am self aware enough to hold back, be patient, examine myself and hope for the best....but I hate that I can't trust myself. It's so messed up that I feel like my world is about to crash and I'm gonna get burned badly and I can't even figure out if it's true or it's my BPD.  


Cause as I said, this guy has issues. We love each other, but he is kind of unpredictable. Sometimes he's super loving and sweet, then the next month he's anxious and distant and drinking too much. Perhaps it's valid to leave him because of that? Maybe I can't handle it? But then again...I love him...and I can't say for sure I wouldn't have a different version of these same problems w another guy.....considering my history.

"Substance abuse Its hard question (in terms of explaining) but i will try as im very curious about your feelings and experiences in that matter.
Peoples with BPD tend to abuse substances. But...but in my case...
I abuse (or used to at days of past) a lots of substances, from different reasons, sometimes triggered emotionally, but mostly often as part of social coexistence. 
When i was for example with mates liking to drink, i was drinking; when i was with someone who smokes, i was smoking etc.
When it starts to be everyday day, *normal* situation i sometimes feel bad with it, but never really...i always know that, and feel that, even in case of smoking weed every day for long period of time that im not addicted. 
I cannot stopped with that but also i cannot stop ( never really wanted) to meet weed-smoking person - it was connected. 
When this person disappear from my life, my, let me say urge for substance disappear also.
It is the case almost in every time...i meet someone, link to them as much as i can, and become kind of addict (if he/she is).
So, i know that lots of peoples with alcohol problem say also that dont have this issue. BUT REALLY, i feel that im not having it from inside needs, there's no craving etc..
And my full question is...do you feel similar or different? What are your experiences?
Do you have problem with substances with not having real problem with them in the same time?",BPD

"Object constancy This is something that a lot of people with BPD suffer from, and it explains so much as to why it has been so challenging for me through my teens and young adult years to maintain relationships/friendships. 
It's essentially the ""out of sight, out of mind"" concept brought to life. If I am not physically interacting with someone, face-to-face, it is REALLY easy for me to forget about them, and forget any sort of memories with that person. Even their face, voice, what it feels like to be with them, etc. becomes so hard for me to picture in my head. This is what makes it so easy for us to split people.

What makes this doubly challenging for me is that my boyfriend lives two hours away, and we are both fairly busy with our own lives. We only see each other maybe twice a month, three times if we are lucky. I've fortunately found little ""anchor thoughts"" that help me stay grounded when I feel myself slipping into an anxious state. 

Anyway just thought I'd share that little bit about object constancy. Because when I first read about it (just a couple weeks ago) EVERYTHING I have EVER experienced finally made sense. ",BPD

He's an amazing man. I'm so lucky. I know it. But I still do everything I can to always push him away. He's so patient and understanding. Or at least he was when we started dating several years ago. Now he's mean and angry all the time. And this is completely my fault. I've turned him into a monster because my BDP was made much worse by my rough pregnancy and the insane hormonal fluctuations of postpartum life.

"Every single friendship I've ever had has ended terribly. I have never had a healthy relationship in my life. I've had 6-7 best friends throughout my lifetime. Every single one has ended on terribly traumatic terms. 

Years ago, I used to point the finger at them, and only share some of the blame with myself. Now I'm becoming aware of this pattern which is making me really reflect on myself and my actions that may be causing this problem.

When a friendship ends, it affects me deeply and feels like 1000 pounds of guilt and loneliness dumped on me at once. 

Most recently, one of my best friends, who knows about my BPD and told me she would be supportive and understanding about it, dropped out of my life because I changed my mind about wanting to be roommates with her. It was shitty of me and I held myself accountable for that poor decision. I asked her to forgive me and understand, and I told her I don't want it to ruin our friendship. She (seemingly) forgave me and we talked a bit after that. Suddenly, she starts ditching and ignoring me. She didn't even have the audacity to explain why or at least tell me how she feels. And to make matters worse, in the meantime, she suddenly became best friends with another ex-best friend of mine that ended terribly as well. So now I get to see these two (who hate me) suck each other's asses on social media while I'm alone, sulking like a little bitch on Reddit.

I can't figure it out and I am begging someone to give me a fucking wake up call. But my 'friends' rather just give up and bail. Why am I not worthy of someone just openly communicating with me?

 I don't know how to have a healthy relationship.",BPD
"[Vent] (also TW: some strong language) Particularly rough episode drove away almost all my friends, and today, I'm having a hard time accepting that. Honestly, on days like these, I'd rather be dead than attempting to live without a solid group of friends, especially when I cannot forget that I'm literally the reason everyone doesn't talk to me anymore. A few months ago, I had a rough anger episode, and ended up blasting a LOT of really vicious, paranoid thoughts and phrases all over my social media pages. A day or so after, I did go back and delete everything, as well as apologize for hurting or scaring anyone with the things I said, but none of those actions really seemed to help put people at ease with me, as I literally cannot remember the last time someone besides one of the only 3 people who talk to me anymore messaged me/replied to a message I've sent. People occasionally react to memes and funny posts I share, but I feel like the human connection really stops there. Now, friends I used to be close to are getting closer to each other (hanging out, tagging each other in things and reacting to it, etc.) while they choose to drift apart from me, and it's a really uncomfortable and upsetting thing to realize. I feel REALLY bad about myself for ever going on the Internet whilst I was in an episode, for having the paranoid thoughts I did, for not putting on my ""social filter"" when I needed to, for causing friendships to die, for even attempting to maintain friendships in the first place, and so much more. I hate having this disorder; it causes me to act like a fucking lunatic completely uncontrollably, and then I have to deal with fallout like losing all my friends because of it. SO tired of the roller coaster that is my life experience, SO tired of ""paying the price"" for my mental illness, just SO FUCKING TIRED OF IT ALL. I WANT MY FRIENDS AND LIFE BACK.

"A Newcomer with Questions and Quandaries I'm not sure why I'm starting here. I have a profound discomfort with my diagnosis, some of that comes from my confusion. My confusion stems from multiple mental health professionals agreeing to the bpd diagnosis but my long term therapist saying that some of the traditional symptoms don't fit, yet he still feels comfortable with this diagnosis. Another part of my discomfort is that I'm trying to sort out my new acceptance of bpd and ptsd at the same time and it is a little overwhelming. I spent years thinking I just had a rather strong case of depression and anxiety and now I'm facing reality as best I can.

I started here maybe becuase it looks welcoming. Maybe because your words feel familiar. 

Here's what I hope someone can help me with. My therapist swears up, down, and sideways bpd is a manifestation of love and affection from the primary parent being given and taken maliciously. That is 100% not the case for me, and my own research shows me that I'm actually much more aligned as quiet bpd, so is there a typical and different cause for that? I moved A LOT as a child and that did fuck with my feelings of security and self, couldn't that just be it? Anyone else have overlap with bpd and ptsd?

"Dizzy/Tingling After Life-Long Fact Disproven? Sorry, I know that sounds really weird, but I wasn't sure how else to describe it.

**Background:** I'm currently in an intensive outpatient program for recent severe depression and suicidal thoughts. I've been having issues with my insurance (s/o to UMR, The Worst™), and they denied my pre-auth to go into a partial hospitalization program, one of the reasons being I have never had a suicide attempt. That's untrue and is written on the records sent by PHP to UMR, but apparently nobody at UMR can read.
With that in mind, I got in contact with the hospital I stayed with inpatient and had them send me my files, which state that when I was 14 (11 years ago), I was treated for a suicide attempt.

I have always -- *always* -- believed and told people that I was 13 when I attempted suicide. I realize this is a pretty innocuous detail and doesn't really matter, but when I read my age on the chart, I had an adrenaline rush (I guess?) and suddenly felt dizzy and like my entire body was tingling and like my chest was float-y???

That's also why I've stopped binge eating and purging (I have diagnosed bulimia)

"Recovery: where to start? Well, it's been 4 years since I was diagnosed, and let me tell you - I'm understanding more and more what BPD means. It feels like I am in my own world with my own coping mechanisms, pathological reactions that come naturally and feel normal... Recovery is a shit load of work, because I realized that I have been mainly focused on my behavior and how I seem externally.  

When I have a slip and again decide to get better, my mind is automatically and subconsciously like: SEEM better. Not be better, but seem better. It's like I'm imagining myself through the eyes of someone who knows everything about me and it's all about ""seeming better"", not actually BEING better. And I just realized that, and it's like an eye-opener. Seem functional, not be functional. And now, I ask myself, what's the point?  

I mean, the point surely exists, but when we compare the importance of the point of actually being better and of the point of just seeming better, there's a big difference. The point of seeming better is, I guess, preventing me from rejection that I am so scared of and by working on seeming better I got better in controlling my impulses and emotions. But that doesn't matter, compared to *actually* being better.  

And then I trick myself: I am better! Just because I fucking seem better and don't have a fucking object permanence and can't see myself as a whole, my inner and my social personality. My social personality is better, I AM NOT.  

Is this recovery? Maybe. Maybe it helps me, but it's not the real recovery. It's nowhere near the real recovery. It's just tricking myself all over again. And I don't have a right to feel frustrated because I'm not getting better and because I am stuck, because I'm not actually doing anything. I'm just putting new layers of make-up on my social personality that I use to defend myself... primarily from my own non-existent self, and then others.  

Wow, I really don't want to live this way.  

**Question for you:** Where to start in terms of recovery (real one)? What should be my first step? I have no idea, man. But I definitely need to work on myself and I should start immediately.",BPD

"Addiction or just BPD? Title seems self-explanatory. I'm a very clingy person, but lately I've been depressed. I usually smoke weed recreationally but this past week I've smoked daily (with or without friends) and today was the first day I didn't do it, but I still wanted to. 

Also, I've been clingier to some people, especially this guy who I'm kind of romantically involved (It's complicated). I've also had episodes in the past of reckless sexual encounters, which only led me to get syphilis.

So. Am I an addict and could probably become an alcoholic or drug-addict in the future or is it just my BPD doing what it does best, which is basically fucking me up?",BPD

"Does anyone do MDMA with their FP? I'm conflicted/nervous about doing it without them. The first time I rolled I didn't have an SO/FP and had an absolute blast. Then, I met my SO/FP and haven't rolled without him since. EDC is coming up and we are looking at the schedule and I am going to roll Friday, and him on Sunday. I'm really nervous I won't have that special connection that I experience with him when we are both rolling. I really love rolling with him at the same time because we can finally be open with our feelings and some of the best moments are when we are open with each other like this. It has a really positive impact on our relationship overall also. It's like therapy for us almost.

"Who else has made life-changing decisions while splitting? Hey. So a couple years ago in 2016, I split probably the worst I ever have and it was on my whole family. 


My family life wasn't the best; my
Mom has BPD, my Dad is a functioning alcoholic, I was molested by my older brother as a young child etc. My parents never apologized when things went batshit. They never explained anything to me. But there was a lot of love and a lot of good things despite all of the problems.  My Mom poured a lot of time and energy into my desire to be a dancer as a teenager. My Dad was usually patient and kind and tried to teach me things. He taught me how to drive. I never wanted for anything. They supported any hobby I got into. I had nice stuff and my parents bought me almost anything I wanted. In a lot of ways I was spoiled as the youngest child of 4. 


After moving away from them at 20, I ended up moving back in later that same year. It was miserable because I was in that weird in between of being a kid and being an adult. I felt isolated and estranged. I started dwelling on my tumultuous and damaging past. I was just starting to figure out that something wasn't right with my brain because I was constantly depressed, anxious, and emotionally unstable. I tried my best to hide this all from my family, even when my sister came to me and said ""mom thinks you're depressed"" I laughed and denied it. 


This dwelling/obsession is what started an almost year long split on my family. Suddenly I had to get away from them; they were the monsters who fucked me up, everything was horrible and tainted in my mind, every genuinely good moment from my childhood I couldn't even remember anymore. I moved to another state, cut off all contact, even contemplated changing my name. It was dramatic and painful and I regret it all so much. The damage I have done to my connection with my family is deep, but hopefully not irreparable. I've been trying extra hard this year to patch things up.

I started talking with my Mom just recently about BPD and she recommended a book and CBD. She also fully supports me starting DBT. Since I've been diagnosed with BPD I've come to understand her and her behavior as well as my own. It doesn't take away the fact that what she put me through as a child was traumatizing, but I get it now and have so much more empathy for her. It's been incredibly healing for me to understand my Mom but I struggle with guilt over what I put her through in 2016. I'm trying to put that behind and build a better relationship with her now. 


Has anyone else made huge life decisions while splitting like this? Has anyone else experienced this kind of prolonged splitting? ",BPD
"She Found Somebody New Hey everyone, looking for some support right now. 

Was seeing somebody with BPD. She went on vacation and said she'd think about what she really wants between. Said she'd message me when she's back. She's back now but she never messaged me.

"sabotaging my relationship and self harming with exes *** trigger self harm*** I've been  very unstable lately, my bpd and anxiety are out of control right now and they're affecting my current relationship, it had never happened before. I was so happy because at last I was having a healthy relationship with a man who absolutely adored me, I felt reassured and loved like never before. But now I'm feeling insecure, I feel he doesn't love me anymore, I feel he's getting bored of me, I know these are probably delusions but I can't stop them and I can't help them. Last night before I texted him good night I told him I loved him with all my soul and he told me he loved me so much, but for some reason I felt this wasn't enough and I had an anxiety attack, I feel ridiculous. I am feeling very terrible, everything in my life is a mess and I can't handle life right now, the only thing that was going well was my relationship and now I seem to be sabotaging it.

I want to self harm so badly, I wanted to harm myself in any way possible so I went on to stalk my ex boyfriend who never really loved me, his ex (whom he always loved and never got over while he was with me) and my current bf's ex. I saw my ex's really old posts telling her he loved her and all sort of romantic things, just to make myself feel even more miserable. I feel both girls (my ex's ex and my bf's ex) are way better than me and I'm ugly and stupid and boring. I want to break up with my bf now, I dont even know why. I saw my bf was online 2 hours ago and didnt say hi to me. Now I'm using this as an excuse to ""prove"" he doesnt love me, just like my ex didnt love me.

My dog sees me get out my blade sometimes and just stares at me. I feel like she knows. When I put it away because I second think myself, she comes over and lays across my thighs. When I do it, she doesn't stop me though. Just cuddles with me literally straight afterwards. She doesn't leave me alone the next day. 

I just cried my eyes out and she jumped straight up on me and sat on my lap like a cat (she does this a lot) and let me cuddle her while crying. 

I got even sadder at the thought of only having her and no one else in the world. People say they care but it is brief. I'm left alone after a while.

"Do you ever block people without regard? Been dating my gf or ex gf with bpd ( i never really know because she always changes the parameters), for a couple of years. Its long distance right now prob will be couple more months.

Over the last three months she would regularly block me with NO cause.

The first few times it was a short ambigious text as an excuse then she would block me before i could reply.

I would try to contact her to get an explaination or closure. She would usually be snotty to me, despite before the ambiguous im blocking you text, hours before she would be texting me how i was husband material and she loves me.

We would usually make up and like clockwork she would block me again in 5-10 days.

Then it progressed to her literally blocking me with ZERO reason. I mean not even an ambigious text to say she's blocking me. I would just contact her and find myself blocked.

We would have a great weekend. Text lovely for the next week, then BAM i wake up and im blocked. No explaination, nothing.

I got a call from her two days ago. I called her back literally 2 seconds later and I was blocked. I am currently blocked again without explaination despite the night before the last text from her being ""goodnight love <3.""

"I split on whoever I am rooming with I really try not to. But all of a sudden, it's like there's a problem that wasn't there. Like I've suppressed it so well that it surprises myself.

And then I ruminate on it and spiral myself into an episode of paranoia, locking myself up in my room and until it passes. 

The only thing that helps is trying to assess the threat mindfully; what I found is that a lot of times it's an intense fear of identity loss. When I see attributes of someone that I blatantly don't agree with, I associate them too much with myself as BPD folk often due because of their empty feelings about self-identity.

"I can't get over my FP (he is my ex) I just can't qui thinking about him and wanting him back in my life. I just frustrates me.

​

We were together for 4 years (on and off, 2 years of the 4 where while being in an open relationship and were really shitty). He was my first relationship and I had incredibly strong feelings for him. We stopped seeing each other around 6 months ago because he got a new girlfriend and now he has blocked me on his phone/social media because I still tried to contact him to remain friends. I have never felt so close to someone like him in my life, he was truly my FP.

​

In the 6 months we haven't seen eachother I have been doing great in every aspect of life but love. I just can't get over him and just want him to part of my life, even if it is just as friends. I didn't want to lose him so badly that I agreed to have an open relationship with him for 2 years even though I didn't want to,

​

Now the most frustrating part about this is that, next to being obsessed with him, I am obsessed with trying to get over him. I just want to fall in love with somebody else so badly so I can move on with my life. Everytime I meet a new guy and we date for a short amount of time (also during the open relationship) I get my hopes up that this will be the guy that will help me get over my ex. And when it doesn't work out I feel destroyed and terrible. 

​

I am so frustrated by both of these feelings (my love for my ex and my obsession with finding somebody to be able to forget him), they consume me, mostly because he has been able to get over me.

​

I respect his choice that he doesn't want to be friends anymore. Although I would love to be able to chat see him sometimes (everytime I go somewhere he may be I get my hopes up that I may be able to see him), I understand that this is not possible right now.

"Naturopathy Anyone tried it? Depression is a huge part of my bpd and I found a naturopath that works with prescribing meds along with natural remedies (or helps you ween off meds if that's what you want to do). I'm just trying to get an adjustment to my current meds as I feel like they haven't been working for quite some time now (I've been on the same ones for 5 years or so). 

Tried a few doctors recently and felt like no one really cared to get to know me or was really listening to my concerns and issues. I have a friend with bi polar who got off her meds working with a naturopath for 3 years and now she swears by her and has been doing awesome for the last year despite having 2 miscarriages and a breakup!

Anyways, I found it really interesting that this one spends two different sessions getting to know you (one is 2 hours and the next is an hour and a half) before deciding his route of treatment. That makes me hopeful that maybe this person will really care to get to know me and listen to me and won't treat me like any other patient with the same generic anti depressant.

But I know a lot of people don't think mental illness can be ""cured"" by natural remedies. However, after being miserable the past few months I decided why not try something new? It's expensive, but I have the money saved so why not?

"My ex wrote this about me I am reeling from this. I tried so hard to see his pain and be there for him and give him space. I was willing to go to counseling, I was willing to change my behavior and told him that. I was not abusive or mean. I struggled with myself and needed a lot of validation yes, but I improved a lot over the course of the relationship. We used to Skype call every night and sleep together, but once he expressed how hard that was I stopped. I needed less and less validation as time went on and I tried so so hard to get him to tell me what his needs were and how I could help get those needs met.


For full disclosure I must mention that when he ended it I had a mental breakdown because he wouldn't talk to me or answer my questions about the breakup and I harrased him via messages. But I did stop and won't be contacting him again. This was the only time I have ever done anything like that.

If what he says is authentic, then I am a true monster that does not realize the destruction they cause until it is too late. If I made someone feel this way when I was trying my absolute best to improve and be a more balanced person, then what kind of person must I be?

""Blanket

One day I came across a warm, fuzzy blanket. The longer I've worn it, the more it's become a part of me. It's something I've worn for so long that I forgot it wasn't even my own in the first place. It was everything I could ever hope for in a blanket: warm, enveloping, and comforting when I needed it. Something I could slough off when I got too hot, and that I could wrap myself in when things were too cold. Every time I took it off, I felt a little colder, so I put it on for longer and longer periods of time. Eventually, I couldn't do anything without wearing it. It felt good for a while. It somehow just felt...right. I got used to it. Eventually, I forgot it was even there. It moved with me, or maybe I was moving with it. The lines between the blanket and my body became ever more blurred.

It tightened its grip.

As I moved through my life I started feeling inexplicably weaker, and found even the most basic things so difficult I could hardly stand it. I couldn't understand why this was happening. I tried therapists. I tried medication. Nothing seemed to give me the strength to carry on. Every so often, I would hear my inner monologue reminding me that at some point in the past, I put on a heavy blanket and haven't taken it off. I didn't know what I was talking to myself about. I dismissed it. Everybody has a certain amount of weight they carry with them; why should I be so different?

It tightened its grip.

By the time I remembered its existence, it was no longer the warm blanket I remembered it as. Over the years, stitch by stitch, it had begun weaving itself into my own body until I could no longer see it without the most careful, surgical self-examination. I had to do something to make it loosen itself just enough for me to get a grip on it. I peered as far back into the past as I could. I noticed that one day, I started acting much differently than normal, and I kept acting that way from then on.

It loosened its grip.

I built up the courage as best as I could, knowing it would hurt more than I could ever imagine. Finding whatever loose texture I could, I gripped tightly and ripped the blanket from my body, its carefully woven fibers torn strand by strand from my pores. Screams echoed until there was nothing but a bloody pile of fabric and a raw, naked, reddened human standing next to it. I was cold. Exposed. I could swear that the blanket was slowly inching its way back towards me, wriggling and writhing in just as much, or even more pain as I was in at that moment; just as cold and afraid and alone. There I stood, raw and shivering, feeling sorry for this poor thing doing the only thing it knew how to do.

If I moved back towards it, I knew it might do something that would make sure I could never take it off again. I knew it was as desperate for warmth as me. I swallowed my pride and my instinct to help alleviate any suffering I came across. I left only bloody footprints in the opposite direction.""",BPD

I'm somewhere between disbelief, heartbreak and anger right now.   

I recently found out that I have a seriously damaged heart (congestive heart failure, enlarged atria, out of control attrial fibrillation, heart muscle damage, and last but not least an ""ejection fraction"" of 23%.  Looks like I've been walking around with this bum ticker for years.  My girlfriend of six months has BPD.  We live together.  This isn't a rant about the challenges of trying desperately to have a love affair with some semblance of normalcy and the tribulations of life with someone suffering from such a terrible disorder.  I'm well versed in the difficulties presented seemingly without cause or warning.  It's a several times a week thing.  And yes, I love her.  She's in treatment and on meds also.  She's trying to get better.

This is about something that has happened since my heart diagnosis and the treatment that I'm going through.    So far the drug treatment has been unsuccessful.  In a few days I will have a cardioconversion and possible cardiac catherization, because the five meds I'm on aren't working.  And I'm a middle age guy, not a senior citizen, so I shouldn't have these heart problems in the first case.  I'm a wee bit concerned that I'm not going to live to be another Methuselah.

Twice now I've tried to deal with calmly / diffuse two of my gf's episodes that lead to my heart going into severe afib.  And when I mentioned to her that if I can't get my heart to calm down and return to a less injurious beat and heart rate, that I'd have to leave the apartment until my heart eases up,  she lost it.  Well that was the worst thing that I could've said.  I was screamed at, being told ""Is this all our relationship means to you?!  You told me that you'd never leave here during an argument!!"" and was told ""I hate you"".  And to be completely honest, I DID say that I wouldn't leave during an argument because I know how severe my girlfriend's fear of abandonment is.  But that was BEFORE I found out that my heart is in such bad shape and was informed by my cardiologist that (obviously) drastically emotional situations put me at greater risk of immediate stroke.  

I'm hurt.  I don't understand how my life is not more important than her BPD need to act out, scream and demand that I just sit there and take the verbal abuse.  I have never been in a relationship with someone where my health and possibly my existence was held in such low importance when it comes to satisfying the person who I'm in love with need to continue with the tantrums, accusations and incredible meanness.  Yes, I know it's bpd and not her.  And not being able to leave to give myself a break means that sooner or later my health WILL be compromised because of this.

I'm angry.  I'm worn and battered at having to fend off wild nonsensical accusations of infidelity, being called a liar, and generally being called a terrible boyfriend.  And being made to endure this increasingly venomous barrage of nastiness without any way to snap her into understanding that she's gone WAY off the rails or have her allow me time to recover, is adding physical injury to emotional pain.

I'm in disbelief.   How can such an intelligent woman, who professes to love me, not comprehend that I have always and will continue to do EVERYTHING in my capacity to not only try to understand things beyond my life experiences (which BPD clearly is), but also be proactive in her recovery from this insidious mental illness?  Do I matter that little?  Does my well being take a second place to continuing an argument, where I'm struggling to maintain a calm in the face of an escalating berating episode?  Apologies come sometimes, which lessens the left over heart pain of the emotional sort.  That helps.

So, if anyone who is likewise afficted by BPD or has dealt with this in their life has any advice or suggestions, I welcome them.  
My intention is to marry this woman.  I love her.  I have no desire to leave her.  I want to be able to not die of a stroke brought on by a crappy heart exacerbated by emotional distress and the  entrapment I'm under duress to maintain currently.  Is there a way to break through my girlfriend's tunnel vision during an episode (if only for my self preservation) long enough to allow my body to calm down?  It's either that or I WILL have to vacate the apartment until my afib is under control.  I don't want to make her abandonment issues to be triggered if I can in any way avoid it happening.  So I'd rather stay put if the situation can be de-escalated.

I'm in need of some advice here, folks.  Thank you.",BPD

My stepfather would call me out to his separate shop where he worked and basically lived isolated from the rest of us for weeks at a time just twenty feet away in the house. A blessing at times as sad as it is to say. Basically at least once a week sometimes more if Id been 'acting up' or stepping out of line he would talk about the some perceived problem or issue he or 'the rest of the family' had with me. I said maybe five words in the span of an hour or two, usually when he paused in his ranting to make me admit Id made a mistake or done something I to disrespect him. Sometimes he would talk for more than an hour. Once I stood in one spot after getting home from school as he talked berated yelled and finally forgave me for whatever thing or series of things Id done to upset him and I stood there for 8 hours.

"Sexually Avoidant Male with BPD ""traits"" Hello all!  I have diagnoses of Major Depression, Social Anxiety Disorder, and ""traits"" of BPD (my therapist - our couples therapist thinks that I'm full BPD) I'm wondering if there are other men out there who are sex avoidant.  I don't relate to trope of BPD men acting out sexually in risky ways.  I'm more paralyzed in to not wanting to have sex because I'm afraid of being a failure in the bedroom.  Obviously, this is a huge point of contention for my wife and myself.  

Are there other men out there who experience this?  What do you do to help shut off the nervousness and allow yourself to be intimate?",BPD

"Existencial Revelation By separating myself in difficult situations as a child primarily the invalidation my parents, forming prolonged deep relationships has always been nearly impossible. Disassociation in childhood lead to blacking out as an adult.

If I do spend time with people I like I over share. Like can't we skip small talk and be best friends already?

"Recently diagnosed by psychologist. Just want to know more information on meds, and other things. In early november I was diagnosed with bpd, and just wanted more information on it. For example my family doctor thought it was bipolar but my psychologist says its borderline.

 And I was wondering if anyone was put on these medications: latuda, and clonazepam. 
These medications make me feel very, very tired at night but also in the morning. 
And with my slight depression he put me on bupropion hcl, which is just recently as of Thursday. He said it should also wake me up a bit but I still notice that I want to be in bed even before I have to take my meds, but between those hours i do have energy that i never had before. Maybe it's an improvement. I'll keep taking them anyways, and see if the side effects slow down.

And for anyone whose seeing a psychologist; do you notice that your overall relationships with people have improved and moods have improved? Not freaking out over the slightest things. I feel like a big heavy weight was lifted off my shoulders during this year wait just to see the dr. ",BPD

"How do you know if it's an addiction? I'm at a module in DBT in which we're talking and doing work on addictions. I ""barely"" have 5/9 BPD symptoms, and this is the one that I consider kind of hazy for myself. Next to suicidal urges, my most destructive impulse problems are with spending and overeating. On one hand, I know it's sometimes how I deal with anxiety and feelings of emptiness. I'll go buy something and sometimes that thing is a bunch of chocolate...

I guess I don't know if it's an addiction or bad coping (or whether or not there is a difference). I don't feel like either of my undesirable behaviours are really that harmful to me (like I'm not in consumer debt nor do I have high blood sugar or blood pressure) but I will admit there are emotionally loaded patterns associated with them. I do find it hard to not think about sugary foods when I know they're readily available in my house, so I will often nibble on them all day if I'm home. I also seem to convince myself that it's okay to buy certain things but feel incredibly guilty for doing so and will hide the items from my partner. I want to save more money but I also know that when I'm making more money (part-time right now), I don't really spend much more than I do now. On the flip side, I also do a good job talking myself out of buying things I don't need or really want.

"Was this questionable behavior, or am i just a ridiculous traumatized person? I was in trauma therapy for a month, I split up with a guy I was dating, and didn't really bring it up, though I was trying to process it.  I eventually said I wanted to talk about it, afraid I'd made the wrong decision.,..therapist said that all she has is my perspective, that he would need to be present in a session, asked me if I wanted to do that, I said it would be odd since we hadn't talked in a month, then she asked if there was someone who knew us personally ...I said no.  So, it seemed to be a topic we couldn't cover.

A month later, my whole life was falling apart trying to process the events that happened with him, and I felt it odd that I saw this therapist weekly with this incredible burden and it was a topic we couldn't cover.  I brought it up again, mentioning that she said it wasn't something to be discussed.  She acted surprised and said I misunderstood her and then was open to talking about him.

When the next session rolled around, she asked if I wanted to talk about him and I said ok...but then I completely dissociated and was paralyzed with grief/confusion.  And also embarrassment with the build up of not talking about it and that there was something wrong with me to be so affected by it.  She worked getting me back in my body and later commented that, ""how can we talk about him, if you dissociate""....as explanation that dissociation is a major problem in my life.

In reality, I don't dissociate like that unless under extreme circumstances *and* in a therapy session, which I have only done for five months.",BPD
"They always say somebody is book smart or streetsmart. Some can even be a mixture of both, but I think there's a third option here... Experience.

Of course, anybody can be any mixture of the three. But there are some people that are not book smart, that are not necessarily streetsmart, but they tend to read other people in a way that nobody else can. That is the Experience. Perhaps Experience isn't the right word, but I feel like anybody that has tried to get a handle on any mental disability can relate to this. We have to learn how to evaluate ourselves, how to control ourselves, we recognize features in ourselves that most people don't even see. Therefore, we recognize these features in other people as well. In my opinion, we can read people in ways that most cannot. We have a different type of knowledge versus your average street or book knowledge. It just so happens to be a less sang song. ",BPD
"Single, pregnant, jobless I had sex with my employee, I was a manager at PetCo. Got knocked up the first time we had sex but didn't realize it until about a month later. We both quit that job before I found out I was pregnant. 

I never really liked him, as a boyfriend, as a friend or really even as a person. Reason being, he's boring, selfish, lazy and overall incompetent and right now he's refusing to even see me because I told him I'll be asking for child support. He's a manchild that spent $1400 on a *sword* at a Renaissance Fair after I told him I'm pregnant but doesn't want to pay $430 a month to support his child. 

I may just hate him extra because I'm bipolar, borderline and pregnant but now I can't even look at him without wanting to punch his stupid face. 

I lost my job at the place I started working at after I quit my job at PetCo. It's complicated because I don't think I was technically fired, otherwise I could have sued because I know they shoved me out of there because of my pregnancy. Coincidentally the same day I told them I shouldn't be carrying 40 lb dog food bags and climbing ladders, they brought the regional manager in and formed this entire list of things I supposedly said and did, most of which either didn't' happen at all or was completely fabricated. 

Skip ahead to now, I'm single, he doesn't want to talk to me or help, I'm pregnant, jobless, scared to find another job because A. I don't know if I can hold a job when I'm so unstable B. I'm scared I will lose the baby from all the stress C. I won't be eligible for maternity leave anywhere I go

I'm an emotional mess, I fluctuate from crying over nothing, to being so angry I could kill someone, to wanting to fuck and I mean just FUCK anyone and everyone because I am just so horny all the time. 

I've started looking for jobs I can do from home, tried to look into sales and even transcribing (which I would be good at, I type 135wpm) but all the one's I've found require a buttload of experience. 

I've resorted to joining a site where I can date guys for money... The thought makes me sick and the types of men who message me make me feel even sicker. My parents are taking care of me and are not by any means poor, but they are struggling and I want some way of income and some way to feel like I'm not complete and total trash that got knocked up, nobody wants me and I can't even hold a job, which is what I am.

"Can't tell if I'm stuck in a cycle, or I actually need to end my relationship. I'm aware that I have a history of idealising my partners to the point of obsession at the beginning of relationships, and then turning on them when my depression inevitably creeps back, either becoming disinterested or actively hating them.

I have been with my current partner for almost two years, and I am thinking of leaving him. I am even feeling romantically interested in someone else. My reasons for feeling like maybe this relationship is not built to last are: he can be quite controlling and sometimes puts me down (getting angry at me for eating junk food, telling me that if I gain weight he won't be attracted to me anymore, even though I am a very healthy weight and generally eat well), he is prone to bursts of unexplained anger (hit my dog too hard, punches walls, etc), he is not very interested in my interests, friends, or things I do, and often tells me that I talk too much.

I'm insanely weepy and nervous; I can be totally normal one moment, then paranoid the next; my boyfriend described me as having 3 personalities, so I've thrown him out of my house (this is the first time this has happened since we started dating). Everything feels like a small rejection, and I'm blowing it all out of proportion. I have suddenly started smoking again (I ended up having to throw away my cigarettes), I want to drink (prev history of alcohol dependency), I've cleared out my bank account (payday not until 2 wks and no food in the house), and I'm flirting with other men online (after accusing my boyfriend of doing this). Despite being able to write it all out and decide not to do these things, the next day I wake up and it starts all over again. 

I'm considering going back onto medication, but I can't afford the prescription (NHS) because I spent all my money, and I doubt I can get away with them giving them to me for free.

You know when you have those few weeks of mental clarity and ""peace"", then you think: ""Man!, I'm actually getting better! My efforts are working, Yay!"". Then it slowly starts to creep up on you until it hits you really hard. That's what it's feels like for me right now, and I know a lot of us have felt like this countless of times too. It's emotionally draining. 

My FP of 5 years and I broke up earlier this year and I thought, all this time, that I was getting better. Less clingy, less worried, less sad. It looks like I was just delusional because I feel like a massive piece of shit right now. This relationship was textbook toxic, yet I stayed because, for some reason, I just couldn't live without him. It goes without saying that I was toxic as well, not just him. I stayed even thought it was one sided, he fucked any cute girl while I was away, although I didn't know this for the first two years or so. I was naive and stupid at my later teens, so even though he never called me his girlfriend, I thought he wasn't fucking anybody until he straight up told me. I HATE myself for not leaving him right then. I remember that night a lot. I was 99 pounds and was starving myself because I knew he liked my skinny frame and I was crying on the floor in a white silky slip with wet hair. He offered to drive me to a family's home but I decided to stay because I did not want to lose this man. That's when I knew I was toxic too. After that, I found out he had a fuck buddy, I kept finding blue hair strands in his apartment and less condoms than before. So much shit happened. So, obviously, it's all down hill from there. He even compared me to the women he was sleeping with and would assure me that they were hotter than me. Thanks man. Way to hit me where you know it hurts. I started getting extremely clingy, annoying and depressed to the point of not showering for a few days after coming back home from seeing him...because I knew he was scheduling a new fuck date with another nobody for the next weekend. This went on to give me huge meltdowns at the airport, where both times I was committed to a ward for attempted suicide. Why was I never enough for him?. He'd make jokes about my skin color, not to mention the nasty racist things he'd say about my race. Like, really, WHAT THE FUCK did I do then to deserve that?. I can go on forever with this. A depressing and sudden abortion, two miscarriages, celebrating it and making fun of the fact that I can't even do what a woman is supposed to. 

I'm a fucked up person. He's a narcissist and I'm just fucked up. I cannot even begin to understand why I still feel like I need him. Why I still feel jealousy?. Our relationship ended the worst way possible. We still talked and met up for awhile after that. It got nasty really quickly. I did unspeakable things for him on camera. I let him do whatever he wanted in complete desperation. I was delusional, at best. Months later and I'm left with pretty bad scars of his name in like 8 different parts of my body, a stick N poke tattoo of his name and a whole lot of exhaustion. What pisses me off is the fact that he's acting like some sort of messiah who suddenly got his act together. I literally only ask him to be upfront about his feelings and to delete every single picture and video I've sent him (they're life ruining) and he ignores it and writes some unwanted advice about how I should ""Fix myself, use mederma\~\~\~ Flyyyy!!<3"". Golly gee, and I thought the whole year of DBT therapy and depression medication was just a show /s. Omg?! Mederma?? Why didn't I think of doing that to my permanent keloid scars, silly me. Fuck right off with that. I'm not asking for advice or pity. I was asking to be talked to like a human being. I was asking for you to remove my explicit pictures and videos, like an ex(?) should (I deleted 99% of everything involving him except for a couple normal pictures of us). But no. That's too much too ask. It feels great knowing that he suddenly ""feels human"" after the relationship was over. Your welcome for being your punching bag. I honestly can't wait for the day his future girlfriends asks about me, because of the pictures he refuses to delete, and then tell her how bad of a person I was but conveniently omit the vile things he did to me.

Yet, even now, I'd jump into his arms in a heartbeat =(. 

You know how I know life is a complete joke for some people?. I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease this past week. Essentially, my body is attacking my thyroid. That's..that's just the cherry on top of all this. Honestly, I feel like my mind and body have failed me. It's not a death sentence by any means but I don't think I can accept any of this anymore. 5 months of effort in bettering myself did nothing. I ruined my body with permanent marks that haunt me. I have no one to talk to, not even my family. I see no future for me past December.

The only bright light I can see is an upcoming trip to a new city. I got the dream dress I've been wanting for ages too, just for this trip. Honest to God, I know this will be one of the last few memorable things I'll be doing and I'm going to make it great. I don't think I can ""fix"" myself; that train is long gone. But I will enjoy my trip and I'll have fun and I'll forget, for a weekend, about all of this shit. I won't lie, I'm constantly coming up with ways to commit a successful suicide and end the mess that's in my head, and even though it won't be today or tomorrow, i'm almost positive it'll happen. I don't think of this as a cry for help, it's more like rant on everything I've had bottled up for months and some sort of acceptance that I'm not capable of struggling and coming out better out of this one. The only thing I'm grateful for is that my little sister doesn't have this mental illness.

"I'm spiraling down and I don't like it Hello,

Alright, this is gonna be a bit long. I've been trying to deal with things on my own, and I thought I was at last getting better and being happy, but I was wrong. I've been trying to pin-point what could have caused it, and here are my guesses:

1) I've lost my job mid-March, and although that was because of funding issues and 2 other people were laid off as well, I can't help but think it's because my worst fears turned out to be true: that they secretly really believed I sucked and was a waste of human flesh, and jumped on the first occasion to get rid of me. I had a bad nervous breakdown around November (after a terrible break-up, end of a bad relationship) where I took about 5 weeks off to get treatment and take a vacation. 

2) I came back 5 days ago from a 2-weeks vacation I took on a whim to India after losing my job. I thought I was getting back to normal, it was sunny, I was happy, active on social media (new found interest in photography...) which meant ego boost from likes/comments, but the last few days there, I started thinking about my ex again on and off, made me teary a few times, and since being back I can't stop crying at random times and have been staying in bed since I don't have to go to work or really do anything. I have trouble feeding myself, and just crave alcohol instead. I was planning on traveling more, but all motivation went to hell.

3) I know this is really stupid, but I think the fact that I realized a few days ago that my ex doesn't follow my spotify playlists anymore has triggered this whole downfall. My ex has me blocked on everything (even deleted/deactivated FB since breakup), and has a new girlfriend (that they met right after we broke up, it hurt really badly that they could just hurt me then move on as if nothing happened). But for some reason, the fact they hadn't stopped following those playlists was a little sign that we were still a little linked somehow, and now that's gone. (I know this is really stupid, I hate myself for being like this)

4) We had a little bit of a rough patch with one of my friends. We had this intense bond, she said several times that she was obsessed with me, would buy me stuff all the time, and would come hang out anytime I needed her (but maybe I took her a bit for granted?). I made the mistake of trying to date her and we had sex a few times... My feelings were confusing, especially because of the breakup with my ex that was fresh and left me really vulnerable (and crazy unstable). So when she announced she was getting a girlfriend I flipped (we had said we'd just be friends), especially because it was someone who hated my guts, and my friend kept on talking about her negatively, emphasizing the fact she was manipulative. I felt abandoned at the time, and asked her to give me some space. I gave the silence treatment for a few weeks, and it was like a switch: I went from wanting to hang out with her all the time, to not wanting to see her at all. However, when she'd want to talk or meet, it would be okay, and I thought we could be friends even though I knew it would never be the same again: I was getting annoyed at the fact she wasn't responding to my texts as quickly, couldn't hangout as much anymore, etc. 
A few days before I went abroad for the vacation, she called me out of the blue which I thought was nice (we hadn't really seen each other much or talked). But she then had to make it weird: a day later, she texts me saying I should know her calling me was a mistake. I was really confused. Turns out she was afraid I would get the wrong idea and that things were getting serious with the gf. I found that preposterous, so I told her I didn't have that idea at all, and that I knew we were just friends and hoped things would go well with gf. I was a bit pissed she'd think that, but whatever, I didn't make too big of a deal out of it.
However, when I come back from the vacation, I realize she's removed me from her FB list and spotify (music was a thing between us, she'd follow my playlists and know I'm alive based on what I listen). I messaged her from my computer, it didn't say delivered, which made me think she blocked my number too. I sent a few FB messages asking her about it, but didn't give her the chance to reply and just blocked her everywhere. I never want to hear from her again. 
She was actually bad for my mental health (as an FP I guess), also addicted to pot so I would smoke quite a bit in her vicinity, and Idk... I do miss what we had if I'm being honest with myself.

5) TW: self-harm

My intrusive thoughts and images are coming back, and they're more gruesome than ever. Now they're about me slaughtering myself rather than just slicing my wrists, like wtf?!

6) I'm really lonely. I've been meeting people off tinder just to meet more people, but the ones who stop responding make me feel like shit. I want sex and fantasize about being promiscuous with random dudes even though I'm gay, and that's not really my thing. At the same time, I find myself disgusting and just want someone to kill me.

7) I don't know what to do with myself. I really want to go back to school because working has been a catastrophe and has disgusted me from my field (scientific research). I keep on thinking about different alternatives: either go back to France to finish medical school (I'm french living in the states), or stay here and do a masters in CS. My parents support me going back since they're the ones who pressured me into doing med in the first place (they're both physicians). I actually wanted to study literature/linguistics/languages/philosophy/writing as a teen. Now, I'm stuck with an unfinished french med degree, a bachelor in both biochemistry and philosophy, and no idea of what to do next. The only thing I could have seen myself becoming in medicine is a psychiatrist, but I'm unstable myself and hate the psychopharm industry, so what's the point? I thought about psychology instead? I'm so lost, I hate myself.

8) I don't have health insurance anymore and said good bye to my therapist before leaving to India (against her advice). She was the first ever therapist I've been to (at age 25...), and even after 6-months I hadn't been able to establish trust and talk about actual problems. I'm not on meds because I stopped them months ago they had been prescribed after the Nov. breakdown (didn't want to get my brain chemistry to be even more imbalanced or addicted). I just want to go back to at least being able to fake being normal like I used to do. Now, I can't even pretend anymore, I've let myself go too much.

How can I stop feeling this pain and void in my heart? It's crushing. I was going to send ""I hate you"" by email to my ex (with more words but you get the idea), and it's taken everything in me to refrain from hitting send. They probably hate me and laugh at me with that new gf of theirs... I want them to know what they did, it's so unfair that I have to suffer the consequences of their shitty actions and they just get a free pass. They broke me mentally and emotionally, even sexually, and now I should just get over it? I wish I could but obviously I haven't been able to. So what should I do? 

I need help, but Idk where to turn. I feel so dumb for everything I say, think, do, feel....",BPD

"So many different hobbies I literally jump from so many different interests/hobbies. It's so annoying like how do I know if I'm truly passionate about something anymore.

"is it possible to acquire BPD traits from someone else, or only within a relationship? This question might be a bit unusual but, well, here goes. I was diagnosed with BPD by my year long therapist a few months ago, and all of this happened in the middle of a very destructive and even emotionally abusive relationship I was having at the time \(that I have not managed to escape yet\). 

Basically I did a lot of reckless things and reached many highs and lows because of this person who I strongly suspect has... some emotional problems going on, whether it's BPD or even narcissism. I have been manipulated, gaslighted and put down by him in many occasions and he's unstable in what he wants and feels, just like me but he becomes callous and withdraws, or prefers having control while I'm constantly fearing abandonment. I have recognized splitting in him. 

Buuut... I'm not a saint in the dynamic either, I swing between hating and loving him and overall it's the worst thing in the world, I just wanted to know if this very self\-destructive situation actually made me temporarily exhibit traits fitting of BPD. Maybe some kind of side effect of everything he is putting me through. Because as much as I have identified with BPD in the past I feel like I do not have it strong enough for it to be really me \(this and my entire family doubting me and claiming I'm looking for ways to justify my dysfunctionality\). So maybe he is the one making me unstable.. even though I have been unstable in the pas, just never to this extreme. Or perhaps, is it just the perfect situation for my BPD characteristics to flare up and come out? ",BPD
"You're doing well. You're doing well. And you. And you. And I'm doing well too.

I was just procrastinating and reading stories of other people. I started comparing some stuff with my own life. And to my shock I found that I did quite well. I moved out from an abusive home after years of depression. I dropped 60 lbs in a year through sheer willpower. I pass examinations with flying colors. And a weird impulse passed over me: I patted my own shoulder and said ""You're doing well"". And I started crying.

I struggled with self-hate from adolescence. I used to cut my arms and hit myself with a fist, put myself to sleep with drugs and alcohol, freeze on purpose. I never felt even a speck of love, sympathy or respect for myself. I see not one pretty thing in my body. I suck at self-care; to be honest I don't even know how to do it.

But at that one fleeting moment, I felt a bit of connection and compassion to myself. And I would love for you to feel it too. So please brag away what you did well. I'm eager to listen. I feel like we BPDs have a tendency to diminish our achievements and focus on the negatives and beat ourselves up (impostor syndrome, anyone?) So please try and appreciate yourself now.

"It's been a month and I just can't stop. Like the title says.. It's been a month since my FP now ex-gf broke up with me. 

I can't stop thinking about her. From waking up and having her be my first thought to attempting to watch porn and thinking of our sexual history. I obsessively check her social media waiting to see her post a picture of a new boyfriend. My thoughts keep circling around what I might have done wrong throughout the relationship. I feel no attraction to anyone. I don't believe anyone will show me affection the way she did. I fucked up. I should have just bent a knee and done anything she wanted. 

How do you stop obsessing, thinking and creeping over a lost love?

Pathetic doesn't begin describe how I feel. NYC has never felt more alone. 


She fucked someone a week into breaking up with me. Told me she no longer loves me and that we're no longer going to be together.

"Quiet borderlines and black and white thinking For me personally, I do not apply my black and white thinking to anyone but directed to myself. For instance, if someone doesn't text me back my emotions immediately go to, ""they hate me"" and when I get a text they go to ""they love me."" I am a male so I've been taught to hide my emotions, perhaps a consequence of this is that I know not to act on these emotions because I know they're wrong, even my anger. This frustrates people because sometimes I don't act when I should. Especially when I'm trying to court women. It's this familiar to anyone? I'm afraid to act on my emotions because I'm afraid it'll ""unleash the beast"" and hurt everyone around me. ",BPD
"Break with my boyfriend is killing me. What do i do? So I'm gonna try to make a long story short. My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years. We love each other dearly. We were each others first real relationship and first everything. (We're 21.) But we know we want to be together forever. It was his idea to go on a break. He basically described it as he feels like he has no time for himself and we're in a routine that we cant get out of. Meaning that our lives consist of work, school, and each other. I'm not going to lie, this is kind of true. We probably spend too much time together. He's just afraid that if we stay like this it will be like this forever. Which is why we want a break. I feel like this could be really good for both of us. We both need a little space. However, I'm taking it really bad. I cant seem to stop trying to talk to him. He said we can, just not all the time like usual. I feel like I have nothing else to do besides for him. Which is probably why I used to spend all my time with him. Give me some advice on what I can do to pass this time? 
(PLEASE do not say ""he's doing this to party, be with other girls, etc"" He is not like that at all. I know him better than anyone and I know he's doing this because he's stressed and afraid.

"BPD support group in Edinburgh, UK Hi all,

Just a quick message (and shameless plug... lol) in case anyone here is local to Edinburgh and interested in a BPD meetup - I should of course say I'm not personally a medical professional etc. so this will have an informal (but safe & supportive of course) environment. From my own experience of there being very few official resources for BPD in our area and from seeing locals with BPD asking if there's any groups available, I thought I'd try to set up a meet. The focus will be on shared experience, DBT discussion and... basically anything Borderline related, it's informal and up to you. Totally open both to those with a formal diagnosis and anyone who strongly identifies with the diagnosis. Nothing is 100% yet, but if there's enough interest I'll set up a venue and get everything going. If you know of anyone this would be helpful for I'd really appreciate if you could let them know.
Feel free to ask anything. Sorry to the mods if this post isn't allowed, just not sure where else to promote this.

"I talk to people I know don't exist I've been professionally diagnosed with BPD and PTSD a few years back. I have no idea if this has anything to do with that, but I've never told anyone this, not even my previous therapists. Basically I'm extremely lonely and have been my whole life. I have characters in my head that I talk to and interact with. They're fake friends, fake family members, I even have a girlfriend.They're not based on anyone I know, they're all completely fictious. When I'm alone we talk to each other, and when I'm in public by myself I interact with them in my head but don't say anything out loud. They mainly just accompany me any place I go, or we have deep conversations at night. I fully know, and have always known, these people aren't real. I've never once believed they were real. So why do I do this? What's wrong with me? And does anyone else do anything remotely similar? I can't find anything online about this. ",BPD
"I had to dump myself today for the second time I dare this guy for maybe 4 months now? Long story short, we've been good friends since the 9th grade. We've kept on and off contact but we've always had what I considered a beautiful friendship and we always had something for each other. I can say without a doubt I e been infatuated with this fucking guy for 6 years.

We ran into each other in a way that seemed like out of a movie. We'd be dating up until I guess today for 4 months.  Everything was great, I fucking love this god damn fucking human being. I thought he loved me too. Told me he did, but I guess maybe I cornered him a bit, but I only said so because I fucking felt it man. 

To spare the details I calmly confronted him how I feel like he always talks about himself and never asks for how I feel and it's like one day to the next he's just... gone ya know. Tells me he cares about me but not how normal people feel. He's a very solitary person, I know how he is and I suppose I believe him. I know he cares about me, but he can't love me like I love him. I really thought he could, but I guess it was an act. 


I feel so lost. I wish I could be his friend, but my emotions are too heavy. I have never felt so fucking loved and I guess it was an illusion. I pressed him to give me a definitive answer as to whether he wanted me. All he could say was yes but not how I think. He spends all his waking moments stuck on philosophizing and thinking about everything and he's just about thought himself out of emotion and romance. 

I miss him so much. I don't know how long it'll take me to move on. I never feel safe in relationships and this time I really did. I didn't have the paranoid voice in my head. I feel like there's nothing I wouldn't do for that fucking man.

"Wrong diagnosis? So I've been trying to get to the bottom of what's wrong with me, I've been in therapy for years for depression yet not getting better, getting worse in fact. I think there's more going on than ""just"" depression and professionals have also told me to look into getting a diagnostic test. I'm like 90% sure I have BPD because the symptoms just fit me perfectly, but I think I'm the quiet subtype. So I feel like I appear relatively together at first because I hold it all in but really I'm imploding.

Now I'm not sure how well mental health people know it or are aware of it and I'm worried about getting another diagnosis that doesn't get me anywhere (been diagnosed wrong before, aka one therapist said I was XY then went to another therapist who was like ummm no I've had patients with that diagnosis and I can tell after like one session with you that that makes no sense).

However today, he made reference to it. The penny didnt even drop until after I got off the phone and started thinking about it. As the cogs in my head started to turn I can feel myself getting more and more upset. 

I dont even know for sure if he even still has it. But I am FUMING. I have so much rage. I feel like he has betrayed my trust and I can never look at him the same way again. It breaks my heart because I had built him up so much, but now I am just so angry.

And I wont be able to speak to him for three days about it because I'm travelling. The relationship was going so well and now I feel like it can't go on. Part of me knows I'm blowing this out of proportion but if I dont get this off my chest I will go all Regina George and have a fit.

"DAE's BPD mainly revolve around themselves? So many posts here about partners, FPs, other people... like when I was first diagnosed my FP was my world, but at the same time I had my own goals and whatnot. I was very ambitious and worked hard towards my goals. At the time of my diagnosis, I didn't know what I wanted because I was failing the classes I needed to become a doctor (something that I had worked hard towards for YEARS).

​

Most of my depression has always revolved around self-loathing and being inadequate. Tbf, at the time of diagnosis I was shitty and controlling when it came to my partner, maybe because of a fear of abandonment. But I'm not that way anymore. As far as I'm concerned, the controlling behavior stemmed from a lot of things - insecurity, a lack of social skills, etc. My current partner and I have a pretty normal, happy, stable relationship, as far as I can tell. We had a few small arguments when we moved in with each other, but we resolved it and everything has been peaceful since. My mood swings now all basically have to do with how shit my life is. All my current BPD traits - mood swings, rage, depression, psychosis, etc. - have nothing to do with relationships at all. I don't even really crave relationships too much anymore.

"How to learn what appropriate boundaries and social conventions are? I am terrible with boundaries or with being empathetic enough to people, but I never realize it in the moment, I only realize it afterwards. Plus in social situations I'll just do what feels right, except since my feelings are all screwed up and inaccurate I end up interrupting people, saying rude things, sharing too much too soon, or asking inappropriately prying questions. So I think I need to learn how to do things like a ""normal"" person.

Are there books I can read? What amount is appropriate to share with an acquaintance? Friend? Family member? Partner? How can I figure out if I'm being selfish or unreasonable or insensitive?

"Dealing with unstable feelings/splitting in relationships and subconsiously treating SOs like options? I feel so terrible and nothing makes sense and I'm a horrible fucking person. Like, what the fuck? Is it BPD or ROCD or like some kind of attachment disorder? Or a fear of intimacy/commmitment?

Why can't I just love properly? This hurts so much.

I fell in love for the first time last year and lost my virginity to this person, but I had mean thoughts about him from the beginning ""my next boyfriend will be better/won't do X or Y"" and I feel like I at times used him or only liked him because he liked me.

At the same time, he was my world and these thoughts caused me EXTREME distress and anxiety so I decided to ask for a ""break"" to ""sort out my feelings"" which ended up being permanent when he decided he didn't want me back.

I cared for him so, so deeply and when he wouldn't take me back I could barely function for almost like three months, as we work together and I still saw him almost everyday. The thought of being with anyone else was not only unappealing, but unbearable. All I could think about was being with him, loving him and being there for him and it was crushing that I couldn't do any of that even though he was right in front of me. I became obsessed with him and drove him away even further.

Fast forward to now and I've met another guy. I attempted to keep it ""casual"" as I still had feelings for my ex when we met. However, we've grown very fond of each other and I feel we might be heading towards something more. I'm very enamoured with him and have almost completely forgotten about my ex.

Most of the time.

We do work together as I mentioned before and as I get closer to my new guy, I have become happier and more like my old self, the one that my ex was attracted to in the first place. So now we're getting along and I can tell he may be interested in me again.

My current BF knows I work with my ex but he is not the jealous type and it doesn't seem to bother him. He is very secure with himself, which is a large part of why I like him so much as I am obviously not secure at all.

But... I keep splitting them both. And it sucks so, so much and it hurts and I just want to sleep forever and turn my brain off.

When my ex and I get along very well, or when I'm upset with my new BF I sort of feel things for my ex again and think about getting back together? But then if my ex does something to piss me off or I'm enjoying time with my BF I'll wonder how I ever could've considered it and it makes me feel EXTREMELY guilty and I just want to cry.

I'm planning on finding another job soon which will definitely help, but it sucks because they both have pros and cons. I think my current BF has more pros than my ex but I can't help but wonder what it would be like if we got back together. He seems to have worked on a lot of stuff that I was unhappy with in the relationship.

My current BF makes me very happy and I think I may be in love with him. When I'm with him my ex doesn't even cross my mind but it still makes me so, so sad to be thinking like this even in passing. I already hurt my ex, I don't want to hurt this man too.

I don't want to to hurt anyone ever again. If I ever cheated, I could never forgive myself. I just want to love the person I'm with fully and without restraint or doubt or fear. Why must I always have one foot out the door? 

Does anyone relate to this? Is there hope for me? Could I ever love how I want to? Or am I doomed to be some fucking heartless pragmatist for the rest of my life? I hate myself. Maybe I don't deserve either of them.",BPD

"Struggling With Accountability and Grace I've been having this issue lately. I'm my harshest critic. I never give myself a pass, I always own up to my part to play in a confrontation, I always apologize first. I was taught humility at a young age by my sister's complete lack of it. 

Recognizing the problem had never been an issue for me. It's the follow through I suck at. I've gotten better, however. Taking steps to ensure that I don't repeat bad behavior. I.e. taking my medication every day, getting sober.

 But naturally I'm still not perfect. I still fuck up. Not in those specific ways but in others. And I still have the fuck ups from the past to grapple with. All my dearest friends, they know that I have this illness and see me for the amazing person I am, so they are constantly being understanding of my behavior, while I try to dismiss their understanding and get them to see how I messed up instead and how me having this illness does not excuse my behavior. Which is true, it doesn't. 

But there's something to be said for giving yourself grace. For not berating yourself and saying that yes, I am sick and there are parts of this I cannot control, but I still need to take the necessary steps to mitigate the problem. 
But I also don't want to excuse my behavior. 
But I also want people to be understanding. 
But I also want people to know what they're getting into with me and decide sooner rather than later if it's too much so I don't get attached. 
But I want someone to take me as I am and be there for the healing process.

I'm constantly angry at myself and my past for the slow but sure conditioning that has made me this way. How much is my fault? How much isn't? Is it worth it to be aware of my family life's roll in all this developing, or does it serve no purpose? 

I just want to be normal.",BPD
"Ulterior Motives Whenever people take the rare initiative to hang out with me I immediately get suspicious there's an ulterior motive. I never believe that people genuinely want to spend time with me, I assume they want something or feel guilty for ditching the depressed girl and just want to make themselves feel better.

I can never be happy either way. I desperately crave any sort of contract from friends but when I receive it I'm too anxious about why it's happening to appreciate it.

"Want to move home but don't want to I just came off of three weeks of the most worry, stress, anxiety, guilt, embarrassment and shame (all at once) that I've ever experienced. Today, I got
the reprieve I needed. But then I started getting worried and preoccupied and stressed and anxious about other thoughts in my head. 

For example, I had one thought in my head that I need to move back home and in with my parents. I now am convinced that because I thought it, I need to do it, even though the cons far outweigh the pros in that situation. Plus, my parents aren't supportive when I'm at my worst, depression-wise. They yell at me and get extremely frustrated.

Im 21 and Ive been diagnosed with depression for around 2 years though it has affected me longer. I go to school, my family loves me and theres pretty much nothing that wrong with my life (well except for having no ""real"" friends since secondary school, dunno if thats the right word for it but anyway) but I feel like everything has gone gradually worse since the start of this year. Suicidal thoughts that plagued me couple of times a week have become daily. There are days when I just cant get myself out of bed. I feel absolutely worthless and I wish my family wouldnt love me so I could just off myself. Things that used to bring some amount of joy to my life dont do anything for me anymore. Absolutely nothing brings me the feeling of ""happiness"". Ive always distracted myself with videogames and such but they just dont work anymore and the only friends I have, I got them randomly on the internet. Now Ive started to push them away for some reason, Im not even sure myself why. I just feel so empty, so overloaded. I havent been able to cry for years, I dont even remember how it feels.

"21(M) New Year, No Motivation, No Idea what to do with my life. 21 (M) with severe anxiety | mild depression (probably more than I admit). 

After graduating high school I did 2 years of generals in college. I didn't get my associates but I know that I'm really close and need to get that finished up. 

Before summer semester of 2016 I dropped all my classes because I hit a wall of depression, also couldn't see the Major I was in working out, and I couldn't pick a new one. I didn't want to waste money aimlessly taking classes with expensive tuition. I am currently on a leave of absence until November when I will have to begin paying my loans back if I'm not enrolled in any courses. 

Financial Standings: March of 2017 I got a full time job (40 hours a week) making $8.50/h I got a raise and will start making $10/h this pay period and my boss said that I'll get a $1 raise in the springtime. I live with my parents and they don't accept any money so 0 expenses on that front (I try not to take it for granted, I'm really grateful to them). I have a car payment of $150/month, but I plan on paying it off by March (~$3000 left). Also car insurance is about $150 a month.. I currently have ~$2000 saved up but I owe at LEAST $10k in student loans. 

I'm super demotivated and bored, nothing interests me career wise... Or at all really, I don't have many friends to hang out with, used to waste life playing video games but they're such a drag that I get bored in like 15 minutes.. I just don't know what to do at all except keep grinding my dead end job while sleeping in my parents basement.

"""Depression is redirected anger"" My therapist told me this once and it has me interested. I notice that as I get more depressed I get angry less often. In fact, all my emotions are less strong. But when I'm in a spell of relative happiness, I feel that I have an actual right to be mad at stuff instead of second guessing my sanity. The tough part about this perspective is that I can't help but feel like the only person worth getting mad at is myself. I wasn't bullied in high school, I have a great family, I have supporting friends. Politics used to make me really angry but it was rarely healthy. I had very questionable beliefs but I actually felt like I was right, that I was worth something, that I had a connection with the outside world. But the truth is that I believed a lot of extreme stuff and it made me hate people I had no business in hating. I was still a little depressed, but since I've moved away from it my depression and anxiety has become way worse. It feels like I have no right to be angry at anything, because I fear that any hint of anger will bring me back there. I may have been a shitty person to others but I felt alive, real, like I had purpose. I have very few genuine complaints with the way other people have treated me, I'm the reason I'm living the life I'm living right now. I'm the reason I'm sad, repressing anger, awkward, weird, etc. so therefore I get into a cycle where I just direct all of my anger inward. I'm always chasing ways to improve myself, I've attached way too much value to girls, sex, and romance.  I lift weights 4-5 times per week but that doesn't help as much. Music used to be a good release but I can't seem to be as into it. As I'm writing this I've found that I actually enjoy writing, so I think I may turn to that instead. I used to journal a lot but since I went back to school I've either been too busy or convinced myself I was too busy. 

I thought the quote was kinda true but I think it has more gravity now. My therapist wasn't trying to belittle depression or anything, she was just pointing out that there's different ways to approach it. I tried searching it up online and I didn't find anything, so I figured I'd start talking about it here since it could be a useful realization. ",depression
"Never felt like this. I really need your help! Hello my dear redditors. I am a 24 yo dude from eastern europe. Two/three months ago I broke up with my ex. She is 19 and pretty much addicted to ecstasy, weed and techno parties; nothing unusual for her age but I got tired of that kind of life. 

She liked to make me mad and see me angry all the time. I almost hit her one time but instead I destroied the furniture. Lately she starter lying to me so she could go at them parties without me(I wouldn't want to go anyway cause I don't want drugs and that shitty ""music"" in my life anymore) and I decided to just break up with her. All I wanted was to work hard, make some savings, have a kid, get a new car etc. so I hooked up with this 30 yo divorced colleague who happens to have a 10 yo daughter. Her daughter looks just like me and she really loves me but now after a month and a half of relationship I realised that I don't love her at all and I hooked up with her just to forget about my ex. We rushed everything, moved together and all that thing...she even asked the manager to put us on the same shift and I feel just exhausted. 

In the past week I barely slept 5 h per night cause I have insomnia. Yesterday I passed out at work and got taken by an ambulance. I was shaking like crazy and my blood pressure was very low. I have no health issues and never had any; even at the hospital they said I'm healthy af and just need to get some rest but I just can not do it. I only have bad toughts all the time. Everytime I think about my ex I am about to cry and everytime I am around my gf I feel exhausted and like fainting. 

Even if I get enough sleep, after 2-3 hours after waking up I am having panic attacks and I have absolutely no controll upon them. They are getting more violent each day. Please, give me some advice... I want to break up with her and be alone for a while but it is very hard now.

"Bipolar and sexual rejection (rejection sensitivity) Hi I'm a 21M and I've been dating my girlfriend (20F) about a year and a half. Our sex lives have been known really take some highs and lows, and this problem is mostly related to sex, but not entirely as it's just a me a problem. 

I've been going to different therapists and taking different anti-depressants for over two years at this point. I struggle with bipolar/manic depression, and I'm currently taking 1250mg of lithium, and it's done fine at keeping me non-suicidal. What it hasn't helped with is social anxiety. I've been reading a bit and I wonder if ADHD is something worth looking into, just as rejection sensitivity is common in ADHD. But I don't really care what my problem is, I just want it fixed. 

To elaborate on my issue, I don't like being told no. And I don't think anyone does, but the way I respond to it is not normal. This response comes about when I'm feeling like being intimate with my girlfriend, and I try to initiate something, only to be met with, ""I'm tired not tonight, baby."" Or something else to that effect. Which is perfectly responsible and at that point I want to leave her alone and not worry about it because I know it's not gonna happen. But I instantly feel such dread upon hearing ""no."" The chain is that I feel sad and disappointed, then I feel like I need to just accept that and be okay with it, then I feel like I can't be okay. I begin feeling a mix of anger and deep depression and the need for sex. It's not horny though, it's just that I'm this moment I feel like sex is the only thing to help me feel better. This feeling continues to spiral and I feel unattractive and unwanted (even if we just had really good connective sex two days ago) and I then I feel things that I know are wrong and I would never vocalize. Things like ""I deserve it"" and ""just have sex with me it's not that big of a deal,"" or ""don't you love me? Have sex with me so I don't have to feel like this."" Again, I know it's super wrong and extremely unfair to my gf to think that, but I can't control those emotions or thoughts. It gets me so distraught that I start wanting to break things and it's been known to have me falling asleep in tears because I feel so afflicted by this feeling. 

I want to feel normal. I feel like I have a pretty good handle on most of my depressive habits, but this is something I've been struggling with for the majority of my time dating this girl. My doctor and therapists have been little to no help in resolving the matter. It feels extremely out of my control despite having been told I'm just a horny boy. I think maybe I'm not saying the right things to my doctor? I have an appointment on Wednesday and I wonder if anyone has ideas of what to say specifically? Similar experiences, medications that have worked for you, thoughts on ADHD being a component of this (I have not been diagnosed with ADHD, I'm just looking at any possibility).

He's in a job that makes him miserable, makes him feel inadequate, drains him of all energy and requires long hours so there's no time for him to do things that help his mental health (gym, hobbies etc). The money is good but it's really killing him. I want him to find another job, but when he looks at jobs it's just an exercise in self-flagilation. If only he did this or that he wouldn't be such a useless person and could apply for these jobs. I tell him it's not true and he's got qualifications he just needs to apply. But of course he'll procrastinate because of the mental stress it causes an will miss the opening. So, he's killing himself at his job but is actively undermining his ability to get a different job. 

He spirals - starts saying horrible things about himself and I'll comfort him and then he'll hate on himself because ""all I use you for is this you're better off without me."" Kind of sentiments.

"uhhh pretty much i am uhh big stupid yeah I'm real real dumb. Yesterday someone told me they like hanging out with me and that we should do it more, that's it. You know what I did with that information, I went home and cut my stomach and legs up worse than I ever have before. Then I took a good deal more than the recommended dose of sleeping pills. Woke up today feeling sick from the pills and stupid from the cuts. Why did someone telling me they like spending time with me make me feel this way. That should be a good thing. I guess I think he probably has a crush on me and maybe I have led him on. Maybe I like him too but it could never work, because every relationship in my life is bound to end. So to me, the beginning of everything just feels like the start of the inevitable end(geez what an emo sentence lol calm down u edgy bitch). Now I want to ghost him to save him from the unfortunate act of liking me, platonically or otherwise. I am not someone anyone should have in their life. I have been making too many friends lately in general. I am tempted to change schools or just cut them all off so I don't have to deal with losing them later. I do not want to be myself anymore. I want to change my name and my look and move somewhere where nobody knows me until they start to know me then do it all over again and repeat until I die. Well, that's all, hope you have a nice day.

"Looking for some meaning Hey there, not really sure how to start with all of this. Never been on reddit to talk about things like this before.

I'm 26, live in the UK, have a wonderful girlfriend, we live together, I'm employed, but more often in the past few months I've just been wondering what the point of life really is. I know a lot of people would kill for the opportunity to have the things that I do, and I'm not taking those for granted in the slightest, but I'm just finding myself feeling lost an awful lot of the time these days.

I feel like over the past year or so, a lot of friends of mine have either devolved into acquaintances, or the kind of ""old friend"" status, where you're still close, but only see each other about once every six months or so due to busier schedules. The ones I do see more frequently, I feel like I'm either not especially close to and can't really confide in, or have their own issues that are much bigger than mine.

My mood right now is pretty low, but there's no real rhyme or reason as to why I feel this way, but something is missing. Part of me wonders if I wasn't here any more, how many people would really miss me, or how long would it affect the ones close to me? I would never really consider suicide as a viable thing, but I just spend some time thinking about that kind of thing.

I guess I'm just looking for some people going through the same thing. If you guys have any advice for what I can do to find some meaning to my life, I'd love to hear it.",depression

I question if I'm alive

My heart beats

My limbs move

My body is fine 

Yet this darkness

Like a river it flows

Through my blood

Poisoning my heart 

Consuming my brain 

I question if I'm alive 

I question if I'm worthless 

I question if I want to be here 

I'm hollow 

Broken 

Useless 

I don't feel anything 

I don't love

"Just called in sick for work Work and everything is taking it's toll. I'm not eating, not sleeping and any sleep I get is all over the place and smoking cigarettes again. I realized i had an issue after a bad drug experience at the end of 2016. I took a month off on the sick and I haven't taken sick time since besides the odd day here and there. I've been to see the psych before regarding schizophrenia to which they said I don't have it, but I know I have something, this isn't just depression and anxiety. I feel psychotic and full of rage many times. I could still be schizo as I couldn't explain my mental processes properly but bipolar runs in my family and relate to bpd as well. 

Whatever it is, I have an appointment again for the 7th March with the psychiatrist and I'm going to make sure I write down my experiences so it's easier to explain. But from now until then I don't see how I'm going to cope in work. I just called in sick for my morning shift tomorrow that's due in 5.5 hours. I'm showing no signs of possibly drifting off to sleep and my paranoia of work itself is making it worse. I told them I'm not eating sleeping and it's becoming too much and told them I'm seeing the doctor tomorrow.

Shall I go to the doctors tomorrow and get a sick note? I'm afraid they'll fire me but in reality they're very soft when it comes to this type of stuff. I've only had one long stretch off work and it was over a year ago. I just need a few weeks where I can rest, go for walks, stop with the cigarettes and eat more. I'm eating healthier than before but still not enough. I'm 133lbs weighing 6ft tall. I look like a smackhead. I even had a comment by someone the other day asking if I'm on heroin as a joke. I just said ""yeah heroin, smack, coke and ket"" with sarcasm. Anyway what should I do? I feel wrong for having extended time off but the place is making me worse at the moment.",depression
"Everything feels pointless, not sure what to do. Throwaway as my girlfriend and friends have accounts and know mine.

I've posted on here for years helping others and now think it's time I need some help myself. Sorry for the long post. I'm male and 29 years old for what it's worth.

For the past few months I've felt empty inside, and everything I do feels pointless. I've had a hard 10 years, starting from very little and fought my way up. I've had to support family, both financially and emotionally (my mother has been chronically depressed, in addition to suffering from a number of other psychiatric problems). I started a company many years ago as a way to give her a job, and be able to help her to have a purpose... this seems to have worked well. But helping her has always been a huge drain on me emotionally. She's attempted suicide at least once, possibly more, and doesn't speak to anyone but me.

Financially I've achieved everything I wanted to. I've bought a house for my mum, live in a house I co-own with my girlfriend, and have a nice car. I have enough savings to take several years off work, and my business is going well - though I am actively involved and the stress at work has been pretty bad for the past year. Between business partners trying to screw us over, lawsuits against suppliers, and just generally having a lot go wrong, it's been a hard 18 months to fight through.

However, I'm fortunate enough to work with my closest friend, and we've had our best year yet commercially.

My girlfriend and I have been together for 9 months, and I was crazy about her, but lately just feel empty. We're not intimate much, mainly because I just have no desire to be. We've talked about this, and I've been honest about how I'm feeling - she's been incredibly supportive. I literally can't fault her in any way. I also don't seem to find her attractive anymore, but I don't even know if this is just me always wanting more or something else... it's worth mentioning I've had a string of short relationships over the past 10 years or so, all of which I ended after a few months to a year, mainly because I found things to fault and talked myself into breaking up. 

It's probably also worth mentioning that a lot of people say I'm a perfectionist in everything I do - I'm not sure to what extent this could be damaging my personal relationships.

I've stopped exercising (used to run/cycle/CrossFit all the time), or having any hobbies really, and even though I've tried getting back into things I just don't have the energy or the motivation. Everything just feels pointless. I feel as though I don't know what I'm trying to achieve anymore, or why. I've always been incredibly ambitious and motivated, but I'm starting to feel that unless my world is falling apart I simply can't motivate myself to do anything - I guess because I lack a purpose? If there's nothing to fix, what's left for me to do?

I realise how ridiculous this sounds, and I'm incredibly fortunate for everything I have and everything I've done, but that doesn't seem to help how I'm feeling. This has been going on for at least 6 months now, possibly longer...

I'm not even sure what I'm looking for posting here - but I guess if you don't try something different you can't get new results! So happy to just get some input, suggestions, whatever...

Thanks everyone.",depression

Which I'm not, the only people who would care about my death are the ones that have to. My heart is heavy with loneliness.

"Gf struggling with depression and I want to support her Hi everyone! I'm new to this subreddit and hope I can find some ease with the support and advice of all you wonderful people. I am M(23) turning (24) and she is F(22) turning (23) this coming week. This is only my 2nd relationship and her 3rd. She and I have been going through a bit of a tough time due to miscommunication in the past. She broke up with me at the beginning of March, but I didn't buy into it totally because I still knew feelings were there on both sides and we kept talking almost like normal. I know, mistake number one on my part. She had said the break up was due to not feeling a connection anymore and after some digging on my part, I discovered that the main problem was misunderstanding on my part. When she would say something or ask for something, I thought I was doing what she had asked, but really I was only doing what I thought she wanted. To be a little more precise and give an example... she would say that she needs space when she's upset but I would take it upon myself to ""interpret"" what she really meant by that. And so I got into the mindset of ""she's upset, she said she needs space, clearly she wants to test me and see if I'll try and comfort her. It lead to a lot of frustration on both parts until I finally got the picture and understood where I went wrong. 

I had talked to her about it and explained that I had just been trying to do what I thought would help instead of just literally hearing and listen to what she was saying. I made a lot of breakthroughs in my thinking and I shared with her what I could while talking to her about it. She says she sees where I'm coming from, but she still feels the way she does even though she wishes she could change it. I began to think that depression plays into it as well when she began opening up more about how she's feeling. She had told me that she doesn't enjoy anything anymore, doesn't have the same energy she used to and just gets so irritated so quickly. She says she wishes she could feel something but just can't. After I opened up my thinking and heard more from her, I felt like I knew how to go about everything and how to be here for her and support her. However she shut down and closed me out ""for my own good"" because I ""deserve better"" and ""should be with someone who isn't messed up like her."" She would try and cut me off and distance herself only to have me fight a little harder to show her I want her in my life. 

At the end of June, she was scheduled to go with a volunteer trip to Puerto Rico to help rebuild homes that were still damaged from the hurricane. We were talking just fine and hanging out fine together, and even had sex, and she had been initiating small little moments of affection (usually a hug and a kiss on my cheek or forehead) and I helped her with a lot of preparation before the trip. The last night I saw her before her trip, July 13th (the last night I've seen her at all) she sat on my lap and hugged me and it seemed like she really didn't want me to go. On her trip, I tried my best to not annoy her and about 2 days into her 14day trip, I stopped messaging her to let her enjoy being there and a week later she told me how she's so stressed about coming back home, mainly due to the stress of our relationship. She said it was the relationship, not me, that was stressing her out. 


When she got back home, I still hadn't heard anything from her. She had been dodging my texts and snapchats and I figured that she wasn't ready to jump back into all the stress and I gave her time and space. 3 days after she got back, she hits me with the ""we need to talk"" text. During that talk, she said that she started finally feeling like herself again during the trip and her mind was starting to clear. She said she'd like time and space to keep feeling like herself again and figure out what she wants. During the trip she said she was going back and forth on whether or not she wanted to try again with me and convincing herself that we aren't going to work because were at two different points in our lives. 

When we had the talk on Monday July, 30th, I addressed that point in our conversation and had explained to her all the changes that have happened and that are continuing to happen because I want a future with her, that I want to be able to earn the right to ask her to be my wife. That was the last conversation I had with her. I'm afraid that I'm too late and that I'm losing her. I would always be the one to initiate contact after she tries to cut me off or distance herself, but it's almost been a month since I last saw her and there hasn't been a day I haven't thought about her. I hate the thought of her being in her own mind alone. She's my best friend and I am hers. She doesn't have many other reliable girl friends and her family situation at home is another stressor. 


Her birthday is next week on the 17th and I don't want her to spend her birthday alone or anytime alone for that matter when all I want to do is be with her and be there for her. Part of me thinks that she wants to reach out but is either too scared to or just not ready. Another part of me is terrified that she might have just realized she's better off without me. Should I text her tomorrow night? I want to give her a little message of support and telling her I'm still thinking about her and that I'm there for her, but I don't know if it will do more harm than good. She asked for space and in the past I hadn't respected it as well as I should have. This is important to her to be able to feel like herself again it's super important to me as well and so I want to respect her space, but at the same time I just want to hear something from her. I was hoping that maybe I would have gotten something from her by now, but I'm still holding on. I don't want to make this about me in anyway, but if she wants to initiate anything, I want to make sure she doesn't feel afraid or nervous to do so. Would I be selfish for texting her 5 days before her birthday after not seeing her in like a month? This is the most pain I've ever felt and the heartbreak only leads me to believe that what I feel for her is true and not just some fling. Any guidance or reassurance would be amazing here. Thank you in advance. 

TLDR; haven't talked to gf/exgf (weird in between phase where feelings are still there) in almost 3 weeks after she said she needed space and time to feel like herself again. We both still care about each other tremendously, but I don't know if I should drop a message to let her know I'm still there for her or if I should continue respecting her wishes and wait for her to initiate contact?

there are people i graduated hs with who have careers, families...i don't even want kids, and idk if i want marriage either but fuck... to have someone who loves me would be really nice. i can barely take care of myself, how can other people take care of kids too?? 

i'm losing my mind over this, i cry every night because i'm so unhappy. i feel like i'm wasting my life and i'm too scared to change. i don't know if i deserve it, if it's worth it, or if i can even do it. when i try to picture my future i just see myself being a stagnant piece of shit with nothing. just like i've been for most of my life

i don't have any goals and i don't think i ever have. idk what i want, i'm not good at anything except smoking weed, sleeping, and wasting time. even just doing that shit im exhausted all the time ",depression

"Trying to educate myself Okay, I will be the first to admit, I have no idea how to help with depression. Smiles and jokes don't help most of the time when my girlfriend gets sad, and lately she's been feeling overwhelmed. She calls me, and cries, either having a panic attack, or feeling depressed. I've never dealt with either of those things personally, and I'm generally extremely upbeat and happy. I really just want to know what to say to help her in these moments. I know I can't ""cure"" it or make it go away completely, but I want to educate myself on this stuff and be as supportive as possible. Mostly looking for links or articles, and maybe some advice?

"Why do we yearn for structure and stability in a world completely perpetuated by chaos? I've done a plethora of drugs in my life including uppers, downers, psychedelics, hypnotics, nootropics, and even RCs (research chemicals) that have little to no clincal backing or research data. Through all this, I've realized a truth that I've know for awhile now but today, that truth is hitting home due to 1mg of clonazepam. On sober days, I forget that the happiness I get from making music is a direct result of having a dopamine spike through dopamine receptors. The stress of not being able to make said music is just cortisol, another ligand. I like to think I'm confident, personable and have no quams about public speaking....but this would dwindle without my testicles sending signals to my thyroid and vice versa to make testosterone. As a finance manager, my mom loves numbers and prides herself in excelling in calculations....but a lobotomy would end all her high functioning energy, her enthusiasm, her will to do any of this as it would anybody who receives a lobotomy. What we consider ourselves isn't anything at all but an idea produced by electric signals that shoot through a fatty squishy mass of grey matter. We aren't anything is the point. Our whole existence is a direct result of the Sun which is just a galactic chemical reaction that just so happens to still be happening.  There is no permenance in the world that we can rely on as a beacon of hope that we can say ""no matter what happens tomorrow, 'This will always be this'.""  And we know this. Yet, here we nurturing this concept of ourselves and designing a life around stability. ",depression
"Just another story. I want to scream but I keep crying. My mouth won't allow me to speak my thoughts. I'm looking for different forms of communication but can't find the actual motivation to look. This was as far as I got. 1st time for everything, hey Reddit 👋🏼. I'm really trying to understand my thoughts, but I begin organizing them trying to figure out which one should I work on understanding 1st? Staring at my phone screen  for too long hurts my eyes from all the crying. Every tear is a flash of imagery from a memory that causes pain, and when I close my eyes it's like watching a flip book of my life and all the things that have hurt me. I'm trying to express myself in the best way I can without seeming annoying or like a spoiled brat or like an emotional freak. I just wonder why I think I would seem any of those ways just by simply trying to express. Why do I cry every time i try to verbally express? I can't deny how annoying and frustrating that actually is having to grasp for air from being out of breath cause of excessive tears from a flip book in my head. I'm sorry for the people who actually don't have someone to express to, I'm not this person. I have a handful of friends, some family, and a man I do love. My problem is different, it's actually expressing and communicating I'm stuck with. As an only kid in an abusive home, we never really spoke about the bad things when they happened and I couldn't tell anyone the bad things when they did happen. I think now that I'm 24 I've developed some type of habit or tradition in not discussing the bad things that happen in my life especially to other people because now I always feel I am burdening them with my problems. Every time I try to discuss a situation that's currently taking place in my life I never know what words to say, or I start crying uncontrollably, or I have to play out several scenarios to get my point across which majority of the time never works. I feel like no one ever understands me. I feel alone in a room full of happy people. So much family but feel loved by none. So many friends but it always feels like one. In one relationship for so long and always feel so alone. Jokes aren't funny anymore and game night is just another night dragging. I saw someone post about adderall and how it helps them proceed throughout the day without these mental interruptions I'm beginning to consider this. It's much better than thinking these thoughts of how I'm useless and why there's no point of being here. I don't even want to go to my doctors appointment in the morning being that my eyes are so puffy from crying so much. Then I'll just be home crying some more. I've been struggling for about 9 months now but the crying is becoming more and more frequent for the past 2-3 months. I am extremely exhausted of feeling so dark, Down, in all types of depressing moods. This is the longest its ever been for me. I want to be able to workout, and juice, and do art and go on adventures like normally but I feel like I'm stuck here on replay but not moving forward. I honestly don't know if anyone will read this but if there is absolutely any advice someone can give me please pass it along I'll consider anything at this point I just want to feel and be better, this is an act of desperation during depression.

"Idk if it's Seasonal. But there's something about this time of year. Maybe it's the family parties where I'm reminded I have no companion. Maybe it's the end of the year, and goals haven't been met. Maybe it's a chemical imbalance? Maybe it's the uncertainty of the future to come or of what I'm currently doing. 

I normally feel it around my birthday in September. And my close family and friends showed extra concern because they know. They asked me how I felt. It was sweet. Even sweeter because I felt great. I felt normal. I was working towards my goals. 

But a few weeks ago it crept in. A few weeks ago, my bed became harder to get out of. Things are slowly becoming harder to do. Or want to do. I'm caring less and putting less effort into any task; cooking, hygiene, health, etc. 

I tell myself suffering is good. Suffering makes you stronger. But nothing ever prepares me for the loss of interest. The not wanting to do anything. 

I push myself every day hoping it goes just as quick as it came. But each day is just a bit harder. And each day I give in just a bit more.

I probably would have ended it by now if it weren't for my being a giant pussy and the thought of what it would do to my parents. I've experienced pain in my life but certainly nothing close to losing a child, and I couldn't do that to them after 20 years of them raising my bitchass and supporting me through various fuckups, but I also don't think I can pretend to be happy and functional for the next however many years just for their sake. Death scares me, but life scares me even more. I want to believe that there's a light at the end of the tunnel, but I can't see it.

"I hate my life, I wanna die, but I don't wanna kill myself Was going to post this on other forms of social media depression groups but I want some sense of anonymity

Basically, I really fucking hate my life. Im a straight white dude whos been homeschooled all my life because my parents are ultra religous, and tbh I don't see the point anymore. I try going to youth groups but that doesn't seem to help. Even though the only friends I have are from youth group, I just don't seem happy there or when I'm with them. I don't talk to all but one of my friends i made in homeschool activity groups because all of there parents hate me. This year I've been taking classes at a local community college, and while it's not as cancerous as the homeschool coops were, it's still bad. Mostly because I've ruined the experience for myself. I'm shy, im awkward, and I have a hard time making friends. Most people I've tried to make friends with at community college and my job hate me. 

About a year ago, I had a girlfriend. It was probably the best time of my life. However, it wouldn't last forever. In the middle of June I found out she cheated on me. That's when this depression started. I thought I would get over it quickly, but no. My relationships with my family started falling apart. I didn't get the score I wanted on the ACT. Things were going really shitty at work. All at the same time. Around early July last year I attempted suicide. Luckily the belt I tried using was old and didn't hold up, but I still think about trying it again everyday. 

About a few months later I decided to download tinder once I thought I was officially over it. Only to find I can't hold any sort of civilized conversation over the fear of the chick hating me, so if anything that made it worse. The fact I hate talking to new people doesn't help either. Since then I've given up trying to find a gf, and just trying to make friends with people, but even that doesn't help

For college, im going to a school 9 hours away. I know they say the social life in college is way better than high school, but I don't know if the long wait is worth it. I don't know if I'll be able to make friends with new people with my anxiety. I don't know if I should even go to college anymore.

Pretty much the only things keeping me alive at this point is the fact that I'm a virgin and the fact I'm too scared to kill myself 

Hell,  with all the recent news coming around, I don't even know if this world is worth living in anymore 

TL;DR: I was homeschooled kid who got cheated on who's about to go off to college who only has a few friends and can't seem to make new ones and wants to die. Help please ",depression
"Could I have Schizoid Personality Disorder? Now obviously a quick internet diagnosis is nothing compared to the real thing, but today I discovered that I fit quite a few of the symptoms, and want to be sure I understand this correctly before I accept it as potentially true.

To begin with, I'm looking at this criteria: 

I fit every point, but the last one is tricky. I get lost in my own thoughts often, but not to the point of impairment. I have no elaborate fantasy world, though I occasionally have philosophical/creative tangents I end up in to pass the time.

Regarding the other symptoms, I fit all of them, but I'm aware of it. In my head I picture a Schizoid person as a person lacking self-awareness to an autistic degree, whereas I'm aware of all these problems and am a perfectly rational person. I just go around like a robot because it feels like my natural state, since I can no longer relate to people or care about them.

"I hate how my emotions and seen as valid I know I have depression (and anxiety), and I'm seeing a therapist to help me, but it still hurts when my emotions aren't taken seriously. More specifically, by my mother.

This morning, while my mother was driving me to school, I had a huge breakdown. I had been (and still am) in a major depressed mood for about half a week, and that morning I crumbled. For the entire 45 minute drive I balled my eyes out, shouting (more at myself than my mother) until we finally reached my school gates.

While I was feeling useless, hopeless, and absolutely miserable about myself, my mother looks at me dead in the eye and says, ""It's just your hormones, your a silly teenage girl. Now stop crying, wash your face and get over it.""

I felt worse then ever after that. I had already been feeling terrible about myself, and my mother says to suck it up. I interpreted that as ""stop being a wuss, you're being pathetic. Control your emotions, because you can. You're emotions aren't real. You're not really sad. Just an idiot teen.""

"""You are a an edgy tumblrcore 16 yr old self diagnosing attention whore""-Says society As a 16 yr old boy in a developed country, with no disability, I feel like my apparent depression, thoughts of death, and excessive anxiety is downplayed. The instant assumption is that a teen in America, who talks about feelings of drowning and wanting to fade into the darkness is likely an attention whore or having hormornal actions.

I have yet to reach out, and it is because these tumblrcore bastards and ignorant parents made it super hard and stressful for this demographic. I spent 2 whole years crying about feeling sad and being afraid, but whenever I go online I see people say:

STOP SAYING YOU ARE DEPRESSED, YOU HAVE NOT SEEN A PROFESSIONAL. MENTAL ILLNESS IS NOT ROMANTIC OR A TOY. YOU ARE A TEENAGER WITH NORMAL FEELINGS, SO SIT THE FUCK DOWN"".
 
Sigh

I have never been diagnosed, so hearing these words do actually hurt. I think I am depressed, I do not know if I can make it halfway through this year without snapping. But attitudes like this make me feel invalidated. My mother does not understand how mental health works.

They think that telling us occasionaly to not be sad for a long time, without being open to listening to our opinions. Telling kids that depression is something scary, but not even counseling them and labeling it as teen behavior is really damaging. I feel like jumping out this window, I am so done. I guess I am just some edgy teen crying for attention, that is why I say I want to kill myself. That is why I have been subscribed and active in Reddit Depression And Suicide Watch since I was 13 or 14 years old.

Even if I kill myself, the word ""depression"" should not be used, since I have no diagnosis to back it up. So I'll continue writing dark things about death until it becomes too much and my emotions tap me on the back, and tell me it's time to go.

"My depression is back again; I wish it would go away. Warning: This is a rant.

So I made a post in October when I was having sort of an episode where I had the desire to die (I don't think I was suicidal though--I wasn't plotting to kill myself or self harm) and I felt very hopeless and empty. It's likely depression as it runs in my family but I still have yet to go to the doctor. The feeling that life is meaningless has always been sitting there in the back of my mind, but it only rarely throws me into episodes where I am so upset that I can't do much of anything for a few days, and then I get over it for the most part and can carry on with my so-called ""life"" again.
Anyway, I am in the throes of yet another one of those ""episodes"", but I have actually already been really sad and stressed for a long time due to school (my junior year in high school) and my verbally abusive parents. It is mostly my mother who likes to tell me daily now that I am a failure and an awful person(ever since I got an F in algebra 2; the struggle to get my grade up was futile). She has these mood swings where one moment she's trying to hug me and says she will do anything she can to help me and loves me and then--I kid you not--the next moment she is screeching expletives at the top of her lungs and is pushing me around because she's in a bad mood or something sets her off.
I want (a.k.a feel the pressure from society) to get my high school diploma, but I just really want to give up and not go to school anymore. I don't even care about my few friendships there...all I want to do is stay at home in bed, either crying about how empty life feels or sleeping. I don't want to die and still have the will to live, but I really don't want to do this anymore. I don't see the point of graduating from school, going to college, and then spending most of my waking hours at a meaningless job. I suppose any job would feel meaningless as life itself feels meaningless. I tried to give myself purpose but I can't find anything there.
My main pastimes are losing myself in fiction, going online, listening to music, and talking to my family members (if they aren't all shaming me for being useless and stupid and screaming at me). I occasionally go outside for walks since it's supposed to help depression (nature and exercise), but I don't think it's affected me significantly. Even though I feel sad, I still can laugh at things and have a sense of humor. It is just that I am never fulfilled or calm. I have friends at school, and even sort of a strange romance...The feelings are mutual, but I'm not dating them because I'm too terrified of getting too personal with someone--platonic or not--again because I would feel overwhelmed. I don't reveal my depressed feelings because I don't care for being all emotional and serious, but I do think depression gets in the way of having friendships and relationships because I am too anxious and unmotivated to cultivate them. This fact itself makes me kind of sad. Even though I like being alone, I still get lonely. It doesn't help that I feel like no one in my family accepts me. They think I'm lying to them about my issues because I am in their eyes so lazy that I'm attempting to escape the work. But to be honest, when I love doing something, I become obsessed with it and throw myself into it. The issue is I don't love doing anything anymore.
My mother scheduled a wellness check-up at the doctor's for me to attend next month, but I strangely fear that they will find that I am completely normal and that my ""depression"" really IS just laziness, or that I'm just really sensitive and dramatic. Simultaneously, I also fear that if I truly am depressed, that even if I go through treatment it won't work and I'll be stuck this way forever, or medicine will shut down my personality...but I guess it would be more beneficial to make sacrifices for happiness, and that the goal is to end my misery.

The point of posting this is because I'm hoping someone can tell me if (if I do indeed have something wrong with my brain) treatment works and what I can do to halt this horrible cycle. I wish I could press pause on reality, because things are catching up and smacking me in the face. I don't want to live like this anymore; I feel like a hamster on a wheel.

I know that sounds insane, but it's the significance of it that gets me.  I feel like no one wants to hang out with someone who cannot give them drugs or interesting things to do.  I cannot provide them what they want, and it hurts.  It hurts because in my eyes I view myself as lesser than them.  They'll all move on and have great lives and reminisce about their crazy young adulthoods, while all I can do is forget about it.  I'm just a useless human being at this point.

"I'm trying to help my gf[19] with her depression and I don't know how to handle it anymore. Its damaging me. Referred here from r/relationships, I hope its more appropriate here


If you're reading this, thank you. I need a place to vent and I appreciate somebody listening. There's a tldr at the bottom and I'm sorry but this is long.


Basic background, I'm a 18m, she's a 19f, both from England. We've been dating for 14 months. I don't know what else to include here really.


Since before we started dating, shes struggled with depression. Since before she met me, shes also refused to go to therapy. She acknowledges they help, cost isn't an issue, she just doesn't 'feel like committing to them'. More on that later


Things were really good for the first 6 months, she hit a few road bumps but I helped her through them in every way I can. But the last 8 months have been flickering between amazing and terrible. When her depression isn't impacting her and when shes feeling good mentally, things are amazing. But she often has 4-5 days every few weeks where she's feeling awful and thats where problems arise


I might be looking like an asshole for thinking its all too much, but I've tried supporting her in every way I possibly can. I'm there for her as much as physically possible and I try so hard and I've sacrificed so much to help her. From sleep (important as I have a medical condition which triggers when I don't get enough sleep, I don't want to say what it is but it can hospitalise me for a day or two) to my own emotional stability. 


I know things are really hard when you have depression, but her coping mechanisms are unhealthy for everyone and she refuses to change them. She gets hugely angry on these depressive episodes and acknowledges this is for no good reason, but says she copes for finding something to be angry at. This is always me because I'm always the one there and she emotionally abuses me for up to hours on ends. I can't leave though because shes suicidal and I can't risk it as I can't bear the risk of her hurting herself.


I basically have to act as her therapist and I don't want to write too much more as there's so much and nobody will want to read everything but the relationship has suffered so much from all this. My needs across the board are completely neglected half the time and maybe expecting more is selfish and maybe thinking I'm too young for all this is selfish, but I can't help feeling that way, maybe I just need someone to tell me I should be doing more and should be doing better. She goes as far as always blaming me for her feeling suicidal, then saying afterwards it isn't me, I'm the only one keeping her alive and she doesn't know why she blames me in the moment. I feel in an impossible situation


I don't know if I've missed any hugely important detail but I just needed to vent and maybe get some opinions. Thank you again if you've read all this, I know its a mess but I am as well atm

"I'll never be able to socialise Like many others I have almost no motivation. The only activities I do during my free time is to watch stuff on youtube or play games, but these days I instead choose to lay in bed rather than do those things. I do study moderately only because I had to change school due to not studying at all. 

However, to socialise is the worst. I have no friends besides my family, and it's been like that for ~6 years now. That wouldn't be so bad if things were changing, but they aren't. Soon I'm an adult. I've actually tried speaking to people in my current class. Smiling, asking them questions about what their interests are and so on. It doesn't end up well. I feel terrible, hate my voice, hate how I have nothing to say because I never do things and that's why I'm totally empty inside (besides having these thoughts and feelings). I'm not able to advance. I wouldn't want to befriend myself, so why should others want to? Also, I judge others harshly. Often I think I'll be better off not being with ""those people"". It isn't always like that, though. I remember a girl in a previous class I was in and thought she was a genuinely nice and beautiful girl, but how am I, a person without interests, friends or courage supposed to be her friend? I realise that I'm extremely hard on myself, and it's no wonder, seeing as I've gone through the better part of my teenage years wandering alone with nothing else to do than think about iife, or how I wish I was in bed.

Therapy didn't work and I've gone to three different school counselors as well. I've wasted years only walking home and watching others do more exciting things. As I'm too tired to try therapy again it's up to me to change things and, deep down inside, I know I'll never be able to make a difference in my life.

"gravity is sucking my whole being into a dark, endless, downward spiral Ever feel like gravity is just taking you whole? I haven't inhabited this deep of an undertaking so suddenly. I received some news today that was less than favorable and with everything on top of the additional news, I think I've reached my breaking point. I feel so heavy with anxiety and am living in an endless thought pool that won't stop. I'm not happy with my living situation, my current job contract, nor my financial situation. I've been dealing with depression and anxiety on my own for the past ten years now and I'm not sure how much more I can take. I've been trying to do things (hobby wise) that are healthy and happy and that highlight the positives in life. But today, I found myself staying in my room all day. Listening to music, and being a prisoner of my own mind. I've reached rock bottom. I'm in financial duress from being a compulsive shopper when I was younger in college and it's finally caught up with me. Court summons for debt owed from a credit card company and a hefty amount due, let alone settled. I'm wishing for the best but I just feel hopeless and alone. I've made huge strides this past year with limiting my spending and I've actually paid off all of my credit cards besides three(which I've been working on), student loans, and my car. I used to use shopping as a hobby and it would make me happy. I could forget or ignore all of my anxieties and sadness and hide them in a cute new top, a pair of shoes, even a trip to Starbucks. All because these things would make me ""happy"".  They were a distraction from real life and real life problems. After I graduated college and started working, I started to realize I had real bills to pay and couldn't afford my credit card lifestyle. But there were still tough days and so I would still go out and buy something to make myself feel better. I know it's ridiculous and irresponsible knowing I couldn't actually afford the items, but it's how I coped. Now that consequence has knocked on my door for my actions, I'm ready to take accountability for my prior mistakes. I'm just not prepared mentally. Dealing with debt collectors is one thing but when one takes the matter to court? Sitting on my bed of shame, embarrassment, and regret, today I mustered the courage to call the the Attorney representing the CC company about potentially settling the debt and forgoing court. I had to leave a VM and I've been a wreck since. I travel for work, and take contracts at various companies(all over the country). What if they cancel my contract due to a court date in another state, and not being able to attend work that week? It negatively impacting future work contracts if we do go to court? Will that be on my record? I'm practically being sued for the amount owed on my CC. This is just a lot to deal with. I know I got myself into this situation in the first place, with my reckless spending, and I'm sure that's mostly why I'm so down on myself. How could I have been so stupid? I hate myself. I make these impulsive choices for immediate gratification of finding contentment with no thought of the consequences. My family is 2,300 miles away and I have no one to help me. No one I can talk to. My mom told me to just wait and see if the Attorney calls me back. But she doesn't understand the turmoil that I'm enduring. ""Waiting"" to an anxious mind is the worst case scenario. And it's dangerous. Too many thoughts. Too many imagined plot paths and conclusions. I feel helpless. I feel like my body is slowly being sucked into a black hole. I envision my skin slowly sliding off my body, taking organs, and vessels, leaving me nothing but bone. Nothingness. I barely can pay my rent, car payment, keep my bills in good standing, let alone my $500 student loan payment. I'm just so afraid of how to handle this situation. If the Attorney won't settle with me before I have to answer to the court, I'll owe the full amount and they can garnish my wages. I'll have nothing for months. Nothing. No place to call home. No food. No car. No job. No family close by. No friends. I'll have nothing but the familiar taste of my tears, the look of sad eyes, and an exhausted mental state. ",depression

"Any advice on how to avoid ruminating about the past? I, unfortunately, have this habit to be stuck in my past, whether it was mistakes, or traumas or an event that I haven't managed to face yet.

This period of rumination and keep feeling stuck to my past happens often. Whether it was because I wished I did something better, or whether I made a mistake or something else like I was motivated to study 3 hours ago instead of 5 hours ago *(for example)*. Because of that, I keep getting stuck in this spiral of silence and darkness and I keep wasting hours of my life doing nothing except feeling sorry for myself and feeling hopeless and often having that ""what-if"" mentality and end up criticising myself.


To give you some information about myself, I will give you the short version:

- I am already diagnosed with depression

- I am seeing a Gestalt therapist who focuses a lot on the ""here and now"". Sometimes it works but since I have this constant habit of ruminating about myself and past mistakes, it is harder for me to focus on the ""here and now""

- I come from an abusive background with parents who always criticised about everything which left me with a very harsh superego that constantly criticises my every move, thought, emotion and so on. It could also be because I was extremely bullied as well when I was a teenager and I was sexually assualted which had an effect on how I see myself.

- I happen to be someone who has very high expectations but very low confidence *(since my parents' actions made them look that they have very little faith in me, even though they often pushed me to the very edge in everything like school, grades and having a decent life and so on)*. Because of that, I often go in a state of panic and anxiety, which is perfect bait for my harsh superego to criticise me even more

- I am a University student who studies psychology (ironically) and my University puts a lot of pressure on me which does not help given that I prioritise my education so much (perhaps too much - I always prioritised my education over everything ever since I was young) and because of that, my anxiety goes too far which puts me in a state of mental burnout (if you look at the Inverted-U Theory of Arousal, I often feel like I am at the far right end of the level of arousal which hinders my performance to study or even to think). And unfortunately, I am extremely hard on myself on pretty much anything - how smart I am, how capable I am in school, whether or not I am worth being a good student (or in fact, a great student) and everything else in life. Plus, the competitiveness that is expected in the world of today, including in the world of education, has left me in a state of constant inferiority which hinders my performance even further.

- I also show symptoms of anxiety and as explained earlier about the pressure I have on the demands of my education *(both from the University and from my parents)*, I often avoid studying or find it hard to study which I know that does not help but I cannot really help it since it feels like I am carrying the entire world on my shoulders

- I also made many mistakes in my life. Some were tiny, some were large, some were how I acted as a person. Almost every single one of them, I still carry the shame and guilt. I feel foolish for making those mistakes. I feel foolish that I allowed my own internal struggle influence my behaviour and not to mention how the world of today that is full of persuasive people and articles *(the bad kind)* who are willing to shove agendas and bias down your throat without a second to think about it. It's a lot of pressure to have a sense of peace in this world when a majority *(and I will say a majority of it because I don't know the data)* is built to influence the attitudes of others, and mostly see people doing it in a negative way like clickbait articles, articles to provoke drama and outgroup bias, articles that do not portray the entire truth. It's scary really how humans, a social species who have the potential to work together to make the world a better place, only to make it more divided becuase of conflicting egos or ignorant or arrogant people or agenda that are willing to push or shove into other people's minds no matter what. It's quite scary how the world is very divided and very intense about many issues *(like global warming, rising issues Brexit and America with its new president, ignorant biases like racism and Islamophobia)*. It's scary and provokes a lot of anxiety. And because of that, because I felt pressured to behave in certain ways because I was too afraid to live how **I desired** because of lack of confidence or because I was afraid of being judged, I behaved in ways that I wasn't myself. I ended up in a constant struggle with my mind *(well, I still do, but it was much worse in the past)* and I acted in ways that to this day, I cannot forgive myself for doing such things. And also more often than not, I am often that I will be remembered for those mistakes *(say, for example, one day I said that there is a God out there but evidently someone proves that there is no such thing as a God, then people will think of me as the idiot who believes in an imaginery phenomenon)*

- And speaking of mistakes, I forgot to add another detail - there is this unchallenged bias that people who are smart or expected to be smart, are expected to always be right. **ALWAYS**. Meaning no mistakes and no fuck ups. I know that we are human and we all make mistakes but I know that people make the wrong assumptions like scientists make a hypothesis and was debunked but imagine a teacher making a mistake in class or a respected scientist makes a mistake in a study or a politician said something that was not accurate *(again, I am mentioning mistakes, not intentional ones)*, imagine the shame and the guilt that they have to carry when someone publically humiliates them, especially how easily distributed and accessable social media is and how it is full of clickbait posts and posts that provoke drama *(I could be biased here but I see it often on social media)*

I keep feeling like I am getting stuck in this period of rumination and I have wasted years of my life doing this and I am sick of it


If you have any advice, or any methods that may help me regarding this issue, please let me know

Thanks


**P.S.** I keep feeling like I have to act like some super-genius with an IQ of 240 24/7 and every time I make a tiny mistake *(like even 2+2=5)*, I feel like I am the worst piece of shit on the planet. I feel like I have to be the best of the best of the best in every single thing in life

"Does anyone else self isolate? And not get that bothered by it? TLDR: 24yo with no motivation to make new friends or spend time with anyone other than myself. This lack of motivation doesn't make me feel bad but I think it's really fucking weird for my age group

Hey, just curious if anyone else has experienced this? I'm 24 and have an awesome job where I work with people who are mostly cool, interesting, smart and empathetic, and I live in the same city as a handful of close friends from high school. Where I live has a huge mid late 20's population and there are multiple events every day where I could meet new people. Despite all this, 90% of the time I would sooo much rather just come home after work and spend time alone smoking weed, reading, sleeping, doing chores or relaxing. 
I've also been in a pretty steady relationship for almost 3 years, she's in the process of getting her own place after living at mine for almost a full year now. So maybe it's just the desire for free time and no obligations. But it bothers me that none of this bothers me, lol. I feel that lots of people around my age get fomo and are really concerned with being ""seen out"" and shit, which is fun but not something that I feel fulfills me. My college experience was pretty wild so maybe it's out of my system? I just find it super weird that I don't have any motivation to make new friendships or even put forth lots of maintenance on the ones I already have. 

I've had a really tough time sticking to commitments in the past, like going to club meetings or even classes. Part of me wonders if my anxiety is subconsciously taking over and eliminating the possibility for me to flake on any plans at all, lol.

I graduated last year and got a job. I'm also in love with my partner and we have a beautiful relationship. I started to feel like depression was gone and although anxiety was still present, it was manageable mainly because of the support I have.

He's been abusing marijuana for the past year and a half and started using alcohol recently too. When we first met he also struggled with sex addiction. He even went on two seperate trips to South America for trying ayahuasca, but the good feeling he gets from all of these things eventually fades away. He constantly has problems with his job, co-workers, family, friends, and me over the past five years that we've been together and way before I came into the picture. His only way to deal with these things are escaping the problem it seems.

I'm feeling helpless at this point. We went to a therapist for 3 sessions, but she wasn't able to give us any guidance (I think she was too timid to give any feedback) and now he's afraid to see a different one. He thinks his problems are because of me and that his depression will go away when we are divorced. 

I hope this doesn't violate the rules here. I'm just venting and trying to see if anyone has been through something similar. It's hard when I'm here all by myself without any friends or family. I don't know how much more I can take. 

Thank you for your time.

"You have to choose between what's honest and what's acceptable Opening up to a person never got me anywhere. You're always at risk of being weird. When I get into a new circle of people and they say some dumb shit, I don't even challenge them or correct them. Because you risk being an annoying shit. When I see that a person has a fragile ego, I tiptoe around it. I don't want them to build a malicious defense of their insecurity. 

Interacting with people always means sucking their dick in some shape or form. You can't change a person's mind, everybody is stubborn. And when a person says they're thinking about your well being, they're thinking about their conscience. All the ugly shit I store inside will never see light of day.",depression

i've been living with depression for about 10 years now, i'm 28. i've had two really bad times, and i'm now it's the third time depression is hitting REALLY HARD. i'm reaching out to you guys because i honestly don't know what to do anymore. or what else i could be doing.

things have not been going great, i don't like my job, i have financial problems, i don't really like the place i live in, i just got broken up with. he said he was having too many problems in his life and couldn't have a relationship right now, but he still tries to talk to me. i wish i had the energy to never answer him again.

for about two weeks now i can't seem to do anything without hurting SO MUCH. i've been forcing myself to get out of bed, to eat something, to take care of my dogs. i feel like i have gone so wrong it's like it's not worth anymore. like i can't possibly fix myself. i used to be good at my job, used to be fast and deal with lot of things, but now life has this weight that comes over me and every little thing i do feels heavy, feels stressful, difficult.

i see people smiling and laughing and realize i can't remember the last time i felt that like. you know, carefree. i'm afraid to talk about this with my friends because i feel like i don't want to be a person in their lives with so much problem. i talk with my family but they are all so fast dealing with their problems that they tell me i should get over all of these things more quickly. i feel like i don't have anyone.

i've been going to the therapist and it's been helpful. she said i'm not giving myself enough time to heal, that i should celebrate more the little things that i manage to do, like eat something, or at least i didn't skip work and that one day i managed to get out of bed and go to the movies, and drawings, i've been drawing again, she says it's a good thing. i'm trying to do this, but i can't shake this feeling that it's not enough. i'm afraid to lose myself, it's like i'm falling and everyday is harder and harder and darker.

Also I never talk to anyone about how I'm really feeling. I feel, they don't need to be bothered by it. They should live their life, have their problems while I keep mine to myself.

"I Honestly Don't Know How to Deal With It I've always been an always happy, easygoing person. I used to be able to bounce back from anything. When I finally moved from my parents house into my new apartment to start college, I felt invigorated, I felt like I was finally setting out to do something great with my life.

I don't understand what happened.

Several months after I moved, I met my boyfriend. Even though he had nothing going on but school, I didn't care. I promised I would take the time to build with him. To rise him up from how down he was before. (Ex wife won't let him see his son and other bs) After my first roommate moved due to the fact she graduated, thats when things started to spiral out of control.

I moved in with a friend. Who turned out to be one of the worst decisions last year. I was subject to her cat peeing on everything. EVERYTHING. She didn't believe me until she saw him pee on one of her things. She kept him in her room after that.  Never cleaned up after herself never helped with cleaning. I thought I could manage. I looked on the brightside. I pretended I wasn't miserable. It didn't help that every time I complained about her that my boyfriend and my mom reminded me that this was all my fault. (My mom wouldn't let me and him live together. I had such a short time to figure out where I was gonna go and find a roommate. My friend was offering her place. She had one bedroom. I decided to split the living room in half and divide it with curtains.)

So I stopped complaining. And I like to believe things were getting better. Then life pretty much said, ""bitch you thought"". 

She thought fixing her cat would solve the problem. While I wasn't home for the weekend she let him out of her room. Everything covered and uncovered when I came back was peed on. And she didn't believe me. And she refused to do anything more about it.

Her lease ends and I move right away, currently living with my boyfriend. Which is so great. The first two weeks. He doesn't have an actual job. For some reason he's against getting one. Even after I told him it was the only way we can stay there. I can't pay for everything. He spends a week looking. Applied to a lot of places. No takers. Then he stopped trying. He got some large commissions (3D freelancer) but they either dont pay enough or dont pay frequently enough. Or both. He was okay with that. I was not. I begged him to get an actual job. He joined Lyft as a driver. I thought that was a step in the right direction. The whole month of January he drove a total of two times. Every time I asked him to drive he would say he didn't want to.

Now we're behind on the electric bill. Rent's coming up and I can't pay for it. My moms rushing me to graduate this year saying if I dont, she'll pull me from college (I'm halfway done). My parents stopped talking to each other. My grandmother is sick. And I can't do anything. I desperately want a job but my school schedule doesn't allow me to fit even a part time job. (Yay full sail)

I find myself constantly bombarded with stress from all sources. I'm only happy for a bit when I play with my cats or play video games. Outside of that I've been completely miserable. I've been contemplating suicide for sometime now. The only thing thats holding me back are my cats. I dont know what to do anymore. My boyfriend says things will be ok. But I dont believe him.

How can they? ",depression

I'll describe it, so basically I think about why she may have done that and it makes me hate myself but then I call myself stupid for hating myself therefore making me hate myself even more. And theres almost a threshold where it's no longer just mental. I start physically hurting myself in many ways and eventually consider suicide. I dont want to do that anymore. I cant get therapy. So I'm forever in this loop. I really hope that I dont go to far. If youre still reading thanks, Glad to know someone who will be here.",depression

My mind feels extremely agitated and I have thoughts which don't make any sense.
I have that thought of not being able to entertain myself. This sounds crazy but it is as it is: what do I have to do to feel good? I have no energy to do what gives me pleasure; I feel so lost in my own self made hole of anxiety that I don't know any more what actually makes fun in life. When I try to do a thing I can't do it straight because of extreme low energy. 

I then feel guilty. Start to hate myself and everything does not make sense. Take drugs. Hurt myself. Be an asshole. Because of not being able to be able to be able?! Not being able to combat depression in the right way. This is what is always in my head, like a thought loop ""you can't do anything to help yourself and you have so low motivation to get out of that hole so you will always be a mess"" and I get extreme anxiety.

Part time job to part time job. I've held a full time job once in the past several years, and that was for a little less than a year.

The stress gets to me. During my last full time gig, my hair was falling out \(I'd wake up to my pillow looking like a cat had rolled all over it\), my IBS was flaring up to the point where I was in the bathroom for about half of the work day, my depression was so wild that I was considering suicide daily, to the point where it became all I thought about. That's when I quit.

But the thing is, aside from long hours and a lot of overtime, the job wasn't particularly hard. I'm not sure what freaks me out so much about working. Part of it is the desire to please everyone, to be a good employee. 

I stay awake all night, tossing and turning, dreading the next day. Even for a damn part time job. I could have a 4 hour shift the next day, and I'll waste the entire previous day just stressing out about working the next day. I get so worked up that I can't enjoy anything else. My whole life turns into a cycle of working and deep depression due to having to go back.

"My short story. This is my first time openly talking about this without it being a therapist  or doctor or something of that sort. So please do forgive me if I seem  rather hesitate in fully disclosing details. Because to be honest, a lot  won't be disclosed but I'll try to my best to make it still something  worth reading. I decided to write this because maybe I'm sick of being  in a dark room by myself and need an outlet to speak. So maybe if I feel  like this goes well I'll keep on with it.

I  don't really know when it started or if it just how I was born but for  as far back as I recall how I feel has been the same. I remember writing  a paper in fourth grade and after finishing it. I decided to hand it to  the teacher to proof read it and she pulled me aside and asked me what  was wrong. I was confused because to me nothing was wrong, but to her I  suppose it required a call home. That night I got enrolled to my first  ever therapist and I had to go weekly. I didn't particularly hate it but  I definitely wasn't taking it serious. I figured if I talked about  video games continuously I'd get whatever video game I wanted. It ended  up working and after a few weeks later I convinced my parents to pull me  out of therapy.

At that age I was never a shut in because of school and travel soccer but I definitely was indoors a lot often.

5th  grade came about and I kept playing soccer but my time was focused  playing video games. To a point where I would have 30 assignments  missing. Now,  I wasn't motivated at all and couldn't care less if I  failed the grade. I just wanted to stay inside and play video games  until late at night. I did pass but having these extraordinarily high  counts of missing assignments would be a reoccurring theme for every  single year following this one. By the time 6th grade rolled around I  was going to tournaments every weekend to play in. Which we were  actually extremely good for our age and with me scoring 20+ goals for  the season. Even though we won or got 2nd place in every single  tournament we were invited to. I couldn't care less if it all crumbled  and I never had to play another day of soccer. I was completely focused  on just being indoors and keeping myself as far away as I could from  human interactions. That summer I moved and even though I did keep  myself indoors a ton the year following this summer. I was extremely  bummed that I was leaving people I had known for years. We moved in and I  had to go to a new school.

I got there  and coming from a small town in the middle of no where to a large city.  The school was defiantly different and I did not connect with anyone. I  did play soccer for this program for the year but I did not care to in  the slightest. More then ever I stayed in my room. Usually until it was  2am on weekdays because of school and just all nighters when I didn't.  Surrounded by darkness was a light emitting from my computer screen  where I'd sit there and play video games, scroll through forums, and  talk on Skype/Teamspeak. Also dabbling in doxing, dosing, and  blackmailing. I really was the definition of someone being toxic. I  interacted with absolutely nobody around me and felt absolutely alone.  This is the same time I started to hate myself but that was only  slightly. This would be the story of my life till the beginning of  freshmen year. None of my tendencies would change but at the beginning  of the year, something did. For the first time I felt I was interacting  with someone. And it was this girl in my grade that I had been crushing  on since the first day I had moved there. I think I just said screw it  and I asked her out while we were walking down the stairs to our class  and she said yes after saying she'd think about it. At the same time I  got my first job and I really felt like there was gonna be a change in  my life for the better. Sometime goes by and I decide to give her this  gift and right in front of me she hands it to this other guy and says he  can have it. Extraordinarily astonished of what just happened and  feeling really hurt. I decided to just push it down and forget about it.  Later that week she tells me her mom doesn't want her dating and that  we have to break up. She even goes as far as to bash her mom. I was  being understanding of it and just tried to forget about it but a week  later I see her with a boy that she had started dating. For some reason  this story has always resonated with me, because of the consequences of  it. I completely gave up on being sociable. That is when I truly became a  shut in and all my worst attributes flourished. I was still working and  did play soccer for a season on some travel team.

Which  meant nothing compared to the amount of hours I spent in my room. Went  back to my tendencies of when I'd stay in my room the years prior. The  only difference is that I had just discovered anime/manga. I sunk my  teeth into it like nothing else could even matter. Every second I had to  forget about how I felt I would pounce on and just watch an anime,  listen to music, or play a video game.

I  spent every second I had over the summer dedicated to it. From 11am to  4am that was my life. In my pitch black room. When school came back up, I  did the absolute bare minimum to pass so I could focus everything on  doing what I ""enjoyed"". The summer break following that year was  probably 3 worst months of my life if it wasn't for the following year's  summer.

I'd stay up till 4am every  night, but if I had soccer workouts I'd stay up the entire night and go  to sleep when I got home from workouts which were from 8-11. I focused  every fucking moment on once again playing video games, anime, and  manga. Pissing away every opportunity I had. When the school year  started I decided I was gonna make a change. It took me 9 weeks to  actually make that decision but I had finally convinced myself I was  gonna try. I end up making my first friend in I don't even know how many  years. She was absolutely hilarious, funny, beautiful, smart. You name  it she had it. We were friends for 2 months and in those 2 months every  night we'd stay up and chat for hours and crack jokes. One day before  Christmas I decided to take her out to eat and we ended up going to her  neighbors apartment. We sat in there and we pretty much knocked  something off. 2 weeks later we had started dating. I really thought  ""This is it"" ""I'm finally gonna change my life"" ""I'm gonna put my  everything to make sure this works out into something impact and meaningful"". Time goes by and for the first time I actually could see  myself in a future where I'm alive past 25 and with someone I truly  would wanna spend my life with. No I didn't think I was in love, but I  did know there was a ton of potential. Some more time goes by and it  starts to get tipsy turny to say the least. I started to slip back into  my habits and decided to just try to help her in anyway I can and  whatever happens to me happens. I completely slip back into my habits  and basically start being obsessed with her and how to help. It gets to a  point where it was genuinely creepy to her but she understood that I  just meant well. Sometime goes by like this and we're both getting  extremely distant. Something occurs with her personal life and she tells  me we should take a break. Which lasted 3 weeks before she told me  we're over. I was still obsessed and was still trying to help in anyway I  could. Weeks go by and we're practically strangers at this point  because of my behavior. It's like this till the end of the school year  and she moves. I had completely slipped back into my habits and while  also being obsessed with her in my head.

On  the last day of exams and the day following. Was probably at my lowest  point because I tried to hang myself so many times I lost count. Every  single time I lost consciousness and fell from where I was hanging. I  knew what the next 3 months had in store for me and i truly couldn't  handle the thought of it. Eventually I gave up, laying in my bed staring  at the door in which I tried to continuously kill myself. I felt  nothing. I quit soccer completely. I had been starving myself for a  couple months at that point but at that point; it couldn't have been  considered anything but a suicide attempt. I didn't eat for days and  when I did it wouldn't even be much of anything. Surprisingly for how  much I had stayed indoors in my life. I was quite fit, even having a 6  pack and extraordinarily muscular legs. After my body had eaten all the  fat it could, if started eating the muscle. Quickly getting skinnier and  skinnier. I got to a point where i couldn't walk down a stair of steps  because of how exhausted I'd because how little I ate. This happened  till the school year started. A month in I get a job at a food place and  I start working myself 35 hrs a week while also going to school. I  wanted to work as much as I possibly could. I didn't care if I dropped  dead while working. I just wanted to forget everything and work. Instead  of starving myself I started to eat 5 if not 6 meals a day. This only  lasted 2 months because then I gotten in a disagreement with my mom  about how I lived and I decided to walk away from home. Somehow they  found me and brought me to a child mental hospital, which I stayed at  for only 3 days. I was assigned a therapist and I told them if they  didn't bring me out of public school I'd drop out. And so they pulled me  out and I started online schooling at home and started working at a  tree cutting company.

It's now December  and I don't know what to do. I'm completely lost. I know I'm gonna keep  slipping back into my tendencies. Rather it be working myself to death  or continue being a shut-in. I don't care at all to finish schooling. I  don't wanna get help, but then again I also do. I've tried to be  productive but it feels impossible. My therapist told me I most likely have ADHD. Which wouldn't help that I was recently diagnosed with  Chronic Depression and Anxiety and it's been suggested to me it may be  crippling. I wanna get on meds to see if it helps, but I know I have had  issues with strongly abusing drugs in the pass so I'm afraid I'll go  back to it.  But I just wanna get help now because I know in the near  future if I don't I'll completely slip back into my habits and the  lifestyles I was living. I have changed for the better, but only minor  ways.

So if anyone could give me some suggestions on what to do I'd extremely appreciate it.

"I'm too pussy to do it I've been contemplating suicide for about 3 years now and have gotten very close to doing it several times. I'm not very smart, I'm not athletic, my parents have openly said I'm a disappointment, I have zero friends, and have never had near success with girls. The only thing keeping me alive is video games and my dog, but my parents have threatened to break my computer so that will not last much longer. The reason I don't kill myself right now is because I'm afraid of the pain, if there was a painless way I would do it. So if anyone knows a way to do it somewhat painlessly that would be great (of course they wouldn't know from experience lmao) but anyways I really don't know the point of this post just got bored and felt like trying to do something for once.

"I can feel it creeping back in For the last five months, I have been genuinely okay for the first time since I was in middle school. I graduated from college (tbh there were times I really did not think I would make it), moved to a new city, have a wonderful new relationship, and started a new job where I get to help people. I never thought I would be able to wake up in the mornings and not feel the weight of mental illness dragging me down. It's been amazing. 

Except I knew this would happen - I can feel the depression (and anxiety/PTSD) creeping back in. I've been dealing with this since I was a teenager, so I can recognize the signs early on. I don't know how deep it's going to get this time, but it's been getting worse each day. I'm being proactive and doing everything I know to do from being in treatment for six years, because I really want to be okay. 

I am not a pessimist, but at this point I'm almost more discouraged than I ever have been about my future. I feel like I've experienced what it's like to be ""normal,"" to live without this weight on my shoulders 24/7 for a little while. I am bracing myself for what will likely be another exhausting six months of just trying to stay alive (based off of my own depressive patterns). I'm only 22 and the thought of having to keep fighting through this for the rest of my life makes me feel like it's hopeless. ",depression

"Depressed due to external circumstances? (girlfriend and friends) I fell out with one of my best friends a few months ago, and around the same time my then girlfriend also broke up with me. Ever since then I guess I've had the symptoms of depression - constantly sad and at best, apathetic at times.

Here's the thing though...how can antidepressants change this? Before I fell out with my friend and before my GF dumped me, I wasn't depressed - I was enjoying life quite a bit. Now its the opposite and has been for months.

Antidepressants can't really change those external situations can they? What's the best approach for this? Therapy and meditation? Hanging out with other friends?",depression

These feelings subsided and I made one last ditch effort at trying to date. Somehow I managed to get two dates only to find the woman deciding our date was ""just a hang out"". I expressed my fatigue and despondence with even trying to find someone to the one friend I can talk about relationships to.

I'm finally seeing within myself the types of people that I want to be, and yet somehow I think that I won't be able to come anywhere near those people because of my paranoia of having to deal with toxic corporate climates, and the fact that if I want to support my friends in lower places, I will have to be as successful as I can overcome the politics and the people who will be out to get me.

"I cut her off but cut myself at the same time I've been depressed for as long as I can remember. It's been a real struggle for me. I've been to three therapists and two psychologists. Nothing really seems to help anymore.

Anyway, about two years ago I met this wonderful woman at a Halloween party. Things were going incredible for a year and a half. I felt happy with her. We made each other laugh and smile. About a year in she proposed to me, and she told me she wants to spend the rest of her life with me. I was ecstatic. I was going to be with her. It was real. Of course we had our ups and downs like any other relationship, but we both were happy. Fast forward to this October. It's my best friends birthday and we want to celebrate. We partied hard. Harder than I've ever partied before. Drunk me thinks that it would be funny to text her that I've taken 21 shots. That wasn't true, and she never really showed real concern. She said, ""You're going to pass out and die."" She didn't call, or send me any other texts. The night goes on and I end up passing out on the couch.

When I get off work the next day, I get a text basically saying I blew it. To sum up what happened, she didn't find the shots joke very funny, and she was worried about me. I tried to talk it out, but I was getting nowhere. She wasn't having my apologies. She broke it off that night because I broke her trust. I realize I fucked up bad. I don't deny that. There's some other details, but I don't really feel like diving into them. 

A couple weeks later I ask her to have lunch with me so we can talk. She's down so I was feeling okay. The night before I ask her if she's still down and she says, ""Sorry, I've got plans."" This just pisses me off. I confront her over text. I just wanted to know why she was so willing to break it off. She said, ""I still love you, I just can't be with you"". Never got a clear answer to my question, and she ended up twisting my words, got pissed off, called me a ""fucking cunt,"" and ignored me for the rest of the night. 

I miss the fuck out of her for the longest time. I still love her and I'm upset. I'm depressed. I didn't know what to do. I stopped going to class. Stopped doing just about everything. Earlier tonight one of my close friends messaged me screenshots of her twitter. She had posted screenshots of our private conversations for all her followers to see. Of course the screenshots were positioned to make me look like a piece of shit. One of the captions was, ""I can't believe I ever dated a cis white male,"" and she also wrote, ""I'm glad shit went down so that I'm out of range, I can't believe I was engaged to this man."" Fucking rage. This is all I felt. I grabbed my boxcutter and went hard as fuck on my forearm. First time I've ever cut. It felt good. It was a release. I also found out she lied about a lot of things. How does someone who claims to still love you say things like that? I ended up sending her the screenshots and telling her goodbye. I blocked and unfriended her on everything. I felt good. I felt a weight off my shoulders. However, that feeling is wearing off and I feel worse than ever. I'm starting to feel like the only way to stop this feeling of constant emptiness is suicide. I've been suicidal before, but this time is different. I don't see myself sticking around here for much longer. Even if nobody bothers this long ass post. It did feel good writing it. I hope others in this incredible community can feel better. Even though she said all that shit about me, I still miss her for some reason. I also feel the urge to cut again. I enjoyed it. 

There is no real love left in this world. I always give people my best. I want to help people. I want the people around me to be happy, but I can only give so much. I think this might be the end soon. Thanks for reading.

"I feel like I'm drowning I've never posted on Reddit before, ever... I'm always too anxious and I don't ever have any original ideas and everyone else just seems so much better, more creative, intelligent... I just don't feel like I'm ever going to contribute anything of worth to the world.

I still don't really know why I'm writing this; honestly, I have no idea if I'm even depressed at all or just stressed out. So many things are happening but at the same time it just seems like the same monotonous routine day after day, year after year... And whenever I see someone else doing something that seems interesting and fun, I realize over and over again that even though I'm so bored, I simultaneously don't have the time or resources to do something that engages me.

Each time this happens, I just wish I could just stop, run away, do something different and unexpected-- but reality always comes crashing down... Everything I'm doing seems like it's preparing me for a brighter, more fun future but every time I feel like approaching it, that future just seems further and further away.

I'm not even lonely. I have a whole group of friends who would do so much for/with me. I have a loving boyfriend who, for many reasons, is the reason I'm still here now. My family says they love me too but... Despite all of this, I just feel trapped. I feel like I need to live to meet their expectations as well as my own but I don't know how much more I can take. It just seems like it's so fragile, like it might all collapse without me, but at the same time, so strong... Like, what difference does it make if I'm there or not? My parents have each other, my friends will move on anyway probably after we all graduate, my boyfriend will (hopefully) move on too... What am I, in this vast universe? 

I feel like I'm drowning. I don't know what to do, I'm trapped, under stress, yet so insignificant. Is this depression? I can smile and laugh and joke and maybe even be happy sometimes, but then when it's all gone, all I have are my thoughts, trapped in my head. I try to think of the bright future everything I'm doing is leading up to but it seems so superficial.

I want to read something. Inspiring, something telling me that it's all worth it, something telling me it's not... I honestly don't care. As long as it's honest, true, real. If you give me advice, I'll try to follow it, but I feel like I probably have no choice but to stay in this monotony until the end of the year, at least. But please, if you see this, just write me something, if you don't mind. 

I've never told this to anyone... Well, I've tried, but I can't ever articulate my feelings quite like I can with writing, anonymously. I don't really know why I'm writing this, still. I should probably go to sleep instead. I hope this resonates with someone at least, but if it doesn't, don't worry! I'll probably be fine, I'm probably just melodramatic. Or stressed. Or... Depressed, maybe? Who knows!",depression

"First Time, Why Is It Always My Fault? This is my first time posting on here, which is weird. This is gonna be a bit of word vomit, hope that's ok.

I'm a senior in college, graduating in 2 days - a semester early. I directed a theatre show and short film this year. I acted in my first films and show this year - I sucked at acting 3 years ago. I live with 3 close friends and was having a good time. Was.

Over the last few months, I've been hit over the head with the depression bat. I had never experienced it like this before. I've made appointments with therapists before, but they were always short term, acute issues. But this has been hanging over me for months, only letting up for a week at most. 

I immediately sought help. My interaction with some friends with depression and anxiety has taught me the warning signs. I now see a therapist weekly and I have a personal trainer to make sure I get exercise. But with all of this going for me, I feel like everything is spiraling out of control.

Over this weekend, my roommates triggered me. I'm not sure how, exactly. It was a bunch of small things all at once. But one of the main things is that I've always felt alone - in a crowd, with a group of good friends, always. For a while, with them, that feeling had been appeased. But, once this triggered, I lost any sort of camaraderie with them. In fact, I couldn't stay in the same room as them without getting intensely angry - to a point I was worried I would hurt them.

So, I lock myself away for several days, but then I talk to them after the most extreme feelings subsided. Now, understand, these guys have all suffered from mental illness. I thought, if anyone would understand, it's them.

Instead, they shoved it back in my face. Essentially blaming me for my feelings. This was after I'd heard, multiple times, that you're not supposed to blame the person suffering - that was their favorite line. Now here I am, coming to them, and they shove it back in my face. They always talk about ""their processes"", but what about mine? It's like they don't even care. And now they don't feel safe living with me either, because I told them the truth about the anger. 

They shoved me back into the pit. I've been alone in this pit many times over the years. I've always found the strength to get out. But I don't know if I have the strength anymore.",depression
"I can't do life anymore...how do I still feeling this way I don't feel like I am made for life.


Let me explain myself. I am 21 years old and I have recently moved out from home with my other half. From the age of 12 I have battled with anxiety, depression, eating disorders and physical health issues. I am struggling with the concept of living. Working 40 hours a week, just to live, is an exhausting and depressing concept to me.


When I was 12 I was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome (or ""M.E."") it's a condition where I felt extremely tired all the time, I was bed bound most days and in a year I probably attended 2-3 weeks of school. This was a distressing time for me and my family; my mum essentially became my full-time carer. Looking back; I believe I was experiencing depression and anxiety, but instead I used the illness as an excuse. I began to gain weight on top of this and slowly developed eating disorders.


Until the age of 17 I struggled with school, barely coping, scraping through my GCSEs. I couldn't get through A Levels and instead attempted to teach myself, which also failed. Then from the age of 18 I had a part time job as a lifeguard while still living at home. This was the first time I was really able to cope. I became more social, more active, I began to properly enjoy life. It was the first time I really felt like I belonged and enjoyed getting up to go to work. (Despite struggling with anorexia/bulimia and an emotionally abusive boyfriend. But that's a whole other post).


I met my boyfriend and now life partner at said job. We have been together for nearly a year and have recently moved in together. I recently left the lifeguard job to pursue social care, I wanted to be a counsellor for the longest time. However, working full time as a support worker in a home for mentally ill completely drained me. I realised this was not the path for me, and I am now working as a customer sales advisor for a home appliance company.


I am miserable in this job, and living with the idea of this now is how I have to live. I still struggle with depression and body issues. I have on and off bouts of uncontrollable crying and sometimes self harm. I want so much to be able to function like a regular person, go to work, eat, sleep. But I can't, I am drained.

"Love or lust? I'm currently in high school and the girl of my dreams (I've liked her since middle school) just started talking to me. At first it was great she talked to me all the time we've hung out, but recently it doesn't feel the same. She doesn't text me much, we hang out still but it seems something has changed. She will send me pics of her but that's just not what I want, I want to feel loved by someone. My homecoming dance is coming next weekend and this is my first time ever going to a dance (I don't go out much I don't really have friends) I'm wondering if I should go with her or even if she's the right girl for me.

"How to motivate myself to clean or do anything really, while dealing with depression. Hi, guys. I'll start this by saying I'm a 35 year old female recovering alcoholic, just for the sake of getting it out there! I've been dealing with depression the majority of my life, and alcohol became a way to numb things, as I'm sure the story goes with many people. I recently decided that it was time to stop the BS and give up the bottle... it does nothing for me and I have spent years ruining my life with it. I'm not on medication, and do not see a therapist.

However, since not drinking, and hell even before, I have found myself dealing with near crippling depression these past few weeks/month. I don't want to get out of bed. I nearly look for reasons to stay IN it. Being that I live alone, have no children and work from home, this is actually incredibly easy for me to do.

I haven't cleaned in at least a month. Probably longer. It's hard to convince myself to even take a shower most of the time. The dishes have piled up to the point where they are almost all dirty, and my house is a genuine wreck - I don't even want to look at it, because it's filthy. I hate it. But I can't seem to motivate myself to do anything about it.

Most of the meals I eat are either frozen or delivered, which is not healthy either, and can occasionally cause me some intestinal issues (again, drinking for years has done a number on me).  I MISS the days when my house was always presentable, and I enjoyed cooking real food. 

If anyone has any tips for me, any suggestion as to what I could do to motivate myself to just do SOMETHING but sleep the day away, I'd be very grateful. Thanks for listening and happy holidays.",depression

"Just need to tell my story WARNING: WALL OF TEXT.

Where do I even start?

Last year around this time, I went over to a friend's house (both of us male. I was a junior in high school and he was a senior) to study for a test. And by friend, I mean we were classmates and we really hadn't hanged out before then. So after about an hour of studying we just get to talking about random stuff and somehow we ended up holding hands. Also, he had a girlfriend of 5 years at the time. When we held hands, I kind of felt like butterflies in my stomach or whatever, just really warm. Over the next few days, we started to get close. We talked about literally everything. He felt like a best friend to me. 

The next time I came over, the first thing I said was ""Can we hold hands?"" and he laughed and said sure. So that happened. And then over the next few days we got even closer. And shared more information with each other. I started to feel attracted and close to him. Eventually I told him that, explaining that I had feelings for him and didn't mean to have led him on or anything. And he told me he had feelings back.

So the next time I come over, I ask ""Can we kiss? I know it's wrong and it would be cheating, but..."" and he goes ""I guess."" And we kiss. For about 4 hours.

Repeat the more texting and getting closer

The next time I come over, we're kissing and cuddling and having a great time. I decided to spend the night. At about 1 in the morning, he goes ""Can I put my hand down your pants?"" and I say yes and it eventually turns into sex. Also, he still has a girlfriend of 5 years at the time this was happening. But he had shared before that he didn't know what he was sexually and he had told his girlfriend that he had no sexual attraction for her.

Anyway, he eventually breaks up with his girlfriend, but not just because of me. He told her about how college was coming up and he didn't think long distance was a good idea and that they are better off as friends anyway. So they break up and I ask him to be my boyfriend a few days later and he says yes.

Also, all of this so far happened over the course of about 3 weeks.

So me and him were officially dating as of January 4, 2017. He made me so happy. I literally saw a future with him. He was perfect to me. We happily dated for months. When it was summer time, he spent a lot of time with his graduated friends and we grew a little distant. I hanged out with my friends who were still in high school while he hanged out with his graduated friends before they all go their separate ways. 

Fast forward to the end of July. Me and my boyfriend were still very much in love. We spent the night at eachother's houses most days of the week. But still a little distant because he hanged out with his friends. I don't know exactly what happened but I started to feel some kind of romantic feelings for one of my friends. I thought they would go away but they didn't. I confessed to that friend and he said he had a crush on me too. But I still dearly loved my boyfriend. So I tell him that I've been having feelings for this other guy and I don't know what to do. And it turns into a talk and we break up, after dating for 7 months. He actually said that he had been meaning to break up for a while because he was going to college and he would be 5 hours away. He said he couldn't do long distance and he didn't need a relationship as he was trying to adjust to college life.

So of course I cried that day but the next day I try and work things out with the guy I had a crush on. 4 days later he tells me ""We should just be friends."" Boom. 2 heartbreaks in a week.

So for the past 4 months, I've been crying and super sad over my first boyfriend. I want him more than anything. He's the love of my life. But wait... the story gets better.

3 days ago, he came to spend the day with me. We were still very good friends after the breakup. He told me (long before 3 days ago) that he had gotten over me in 3 weeks. I, however, have been struggling for 4 months. I had just started to feel a little better. 

Anyways, he comes to spend the day with me, stuff happens, and it turns out that he has to spend the night at my house. I thought I would be fine with it. It's just my ex staying at my house, I can handle it. As we both go to sleep I have an uncontrollable urge to just hug him and cuddle the whole night. I literally felt sick to my stomach and couldn't sleep because I couldn't do anything. I eventually drift to sleep and in the middle of the night I woke up and went to cuddle him. And he cuddles me back. 

I wake up at 7 and decide to hold his hand. While he is asleep. For 2 hours. When he woke up, I asked ""Is it okay if I keep hugging you?"" and he goes ""I guess..."". So I'm just awkwardly hugging him and I ask if I can kiss him, because I was feeling very confused. He says ""I don't think that's a good idea, but if you want"". And that turns into making out and sex. And right after we finished having sex, he left (but I know he had to leave at a certain time, and after sex, it happened to be that time).

So here I am now. Non-stop crying for the past few days. Not hungry at all. Feeling miserable. Wanting my boyfriend back more than anything in the world. Not sure what to even do. I texted him yesterday telling him all of my feelings and regrets and such and he replies with ""Let me sit on this so I can come up with a response"" and he hasn't replied since. Every second feels like forever and I'm drowning in my own feelings. What should I do?

"I need answers . I want to find love Hi im 16 years old and before i start i already was in  a relationship . Two to be exact but none of them were satisfying for me as both of them lasted approximately 3-4 months my whole life I have been surrounded by guy friends whose dating lives were flourishing . It was so easy for them to introduce themselves to girls and start a relationship but most of them even my brother were never emotionnaly attached to a girl as you should be in a relationship . there ultimate goal was just to have sex with them , plus cheat on them with other girls . You can say that im friends with assholes and it might be right but every guy friend did the same . Now this is where i come in , as i stated above i was in 2 relationships which ended abruptly without no reason in these 2 experiments i always took the blame , i was always the one who was the reason for all that is bad in those relationships and i don't think i am . My 2 exes were very very and i mean very control-y type of girls they always asked me where i was and what was i doing when i wasn't wasting hours of my life texting them and talking about nothing interesting whatsoever instead of doing something productive with my life . But what interested me the most was always the QUESTION : WHY? . Why was i in these relationships in the first place i dated 2 beautiful and attractive girls just because they said yes and i tought that it was finally time for me to be in a relationship but come to think about it. I should have never asked them out . I can say that im a funny guy i can make everybody else laugh so naturally which made me attractive to some girls but my looks and body didn't make me go all the way through with all the girls so i wasn't left with too much choice . Now back to the main problem : I NEVER FELT GOOD IN THOSE RELATIONSHIPS . All i was doing is trying to make the girl laugh and feel good about herself but never actually tought about what I needed as a guy . When i asked them out they would say No and when i don't they kept saying that i didn't care about them . So i'm left with a weird spot i met a girl in my highschool a week ago and she is so lovely she is beautiful funny and smart but in our conversations i felt the same vibes that i felt in my previous toxic relationships : I MAKE THE GIRL HAVE FUN AND LAUGH AND FEEL GOOD BUT I NEVER ACTUALLY STOOD FOR A MINUTE AND FOUND MY SELF BEING SATISFYED WHATSOVEVER . but My heart says otherwise i fell in love with her deeply but my brain says no So what should i do? . NOTE: Im a tad bit of an introvert . But in the end should i ask this girl out and go for it ? or should i not even attempt dating until i find the ONE?",depression
"Feeling discouraged I've been trying to become more productive but I just don't feel like I'm actually getting anywhere. I honestly feel really pathetic. It's embarrassing to write. Whatever man. Every day I learn about how I have been wrong about something in a fundamental way, such as the way I think, yet knowing that...I don't know. It's really depressing. I can't tell if it's anxiety that makes me absolutely loath this process or what. I'm finding it difficult to just look at things from that objective angle. You know, like a man. Someone who just didn't give a fuck. I've never had that kind of emotional fortitude. I do give a fuck. I probably give too many fucks. I don't know whether to try to control these emotions or let myself feel them. I can't tell if I don't get a grip because it'd easier not to, or if it's just really, really difficult. I feel like this anxiety and cloudy mind are fundamental reasons why I'm going nowhere and why it feels like I'm going nowhere when someone else might say that I'm moving forward. Part of me is just thinking all of this pondering is a complete waste of time, but I don't know...I think I have a fear of letting go of the emotional baggage and replacing it with curiosity for what's around me. It's so uncertain. I often wonder how much I can really help myself. What if I don't have the intelligence? What if I never learn the right things from my experiences? A wave of existential dread is washing over me. I'm terrified of the future, terrified of the world, and I'm terrified of suffering. Above all, I'm just tired. I can't be proud of myself for being here, but I'm too scared to go anywhere else. My mom is right. I'm definetely going to be a failure if I don't grow some balls. I just don't have any faith of that happening.  I feel utterly hopeless, and it's all my fault. ",depression
"How do you tell if you lack serotonin, dopamine, or both? Normally I'm in a decent mood, my only problem is I can not enjoy anything. If I take my ADHD meds then I can do things, even things that you're supposed to enjoy but I don't enjoy them. I just do them because I'm a human and that's what I'm supposed to do. It always feels like I'm doing nothing even when I'm doing something.

I start to think that maybe both are low, but how would that work? From every site I've seen on the symptoms of low serotonin and low dopamine, it's impossible to be low on both because the symptoms are complete opposites of each other.

I was recently put on Zoloft and I'm wondering if it's possible that it will let me enjoy things when I am on my ADHD medication. If it doesn't do that, then I don't see the point in taking it.

EDIT: Also, I've seen some things about what they teach you in therapy and how to change your thinking in life to benefit you. Does anyone have a list or a resource on these ways of thinking and techniques? I don't know how to google for it because the only advice is the generic ""eat healthy, exercise"" stuff.",depression
"But why of all people would you do that? So, this is an ongoing battle between my parents and I. We have the best of days and then all of a sudden they flip the fuck out on me and turn me into a depressed state. This is one of the many times...

So, currently I'm on the hunt for a job. I don't have much experience in the field I want to go to. I'm 25 no college degree (I failed out, story for another time) and trying to pay off my student loans. Now, not working already puts me in a state of mind that I'm so worthless I cant even bring anything to the table at a job. 

Nevertheless, I told my parental units a few weeks ago that I had a graduation party I wanted to go to. Didnt have money for gift so I didnt want to be that person who showed up without a gift. So yesterday after a nice breakfast I went up to sprawl out on my bed. Next thing I know its like 330 in the afternoon. My dad comes up and starts saying things like I thought you were going to this party. I explained I didnt have money for a gift and I didnt want to intrude a party like that (for some reason this is their growing up plan. I got the manners and all). He told me that if I was going to sleep all day that I should go to bed earlier. I told him that I came right up here yesterday night didnt even turn on any consoles or anything and passed out. I even forgot to turn my light out. 

My dad didnt like that reasoning and said that the world doesnt revolve around me, and left my room. Like I knew my mom wanted to go out that's why I asked her at breakfast what time she wanted to go. She said not for a few hours and by my standards 1130 to 330 is a few hours. So, I asked her when she wanted to leave and she grunted and shrugged her shoulders at me. 

I don't personally believe anything I did warranted these responses. And I've just kinda hit Fuck It Mode. I dont care about anything, my social life has suffered, I do have a pretty shitty sleeping schedule. My eating habits are not normal. Any attempt of rekindling anything from yesterday is met with an eye roll and is thrown back in my face. This is getting to be toxic and handling it is becoming difficult. ",depression

Also  watching porn is strictly prohibited in my religion. This is my only depression trigger. My brain goes like what would she think of me. Why I did not change my password? Why I downloaded the videos to my gallery? It took many months to just forget this situation but recently we had a fight and she said to show her my phone. I did not because I still watch porn. She still thinks that I watch porn instead of studying in my room. This thing just kills me. I always wanted my mom to think good of me.",depression

"I want to die. I need to end this pain and suffering. September 2017- admitted myself to psychiatric hospital with strong suicidal ideation and lethargic depression. Sertraline 5 days intolerable.

More tolerable than mirtazapine. But it made my suicidal ideation worse. A psychiatrist diagnosed me with depression and anxiety, cannabis dependency, borderline and avoidant personality disorder mixed. 2 months in rather than switching medication, I started mixing duloxetine (60mg) with weed and nicotineto cope. At first I convinced myself they synergised. In retrospect though- terrible combo. Continued mixing for 10 months. 12 days no nicotine. 2 days no weed. I'm so lethargic: sleeping 14 hours a day, not exercising, no social interaction, strong suicidal ideation. I'm worse than when I started antidepressants. I think I should come off duloxetine. The withdrawals scare me. My GP isn't aware of my self-medicating. I'm worried if I tell the truth I'll get sectioned. 3 weeks in a psychiatric ward voluntarily was traumatic. ",depression

"Looking to connect // Advice Hello reddit,

I recently made this ""anonymous"" user name due to not wanting to go ""public"" using my regular information or a name that may give me away somehow, although I realize the likelihood is slim due to the massive amount of users and my relatively inconsequential existence. I wanted to come here to air some feelings in hopes I can find other males who have been or are going through my situation. Up until about 30, my life was going along well, I was about to finish graduate school, had a job, house, dog, and a good dating life. I finished graduate school about a year and a half ago, and continued to work in my old job due to not being able to find a decent job within my new field. This went on for about a year, and throughout that time I have become pretty depressed as this job was very rudimentary and mind numbingly routine (dispatcher) and I felt like I was not living up to my potential. Outside life was ok. Fast forward to this past August, the company went under and was bought out by another company. Since then, I have been unemployed and struggling majorly with sleep, depression, self-esteem, and suicidal ideation. I broke up with the girl I was seeing due to feeling inept and having low confidence, have been having night terrors, crying spells, etc. I continue to exercise, eat healthy, reach out for support from a great family and friend group, yet I still feel majorly off. I started seeing a therapist once a week and began a low dose of Celexa, but not wanting to end it is a daily struggle. I think it is hitting me that I should be more able to handle life being 32, educated...and from the outside; successful, well-groomed, etc., but inside I am anything but.

"What to do? Ever since I started high school my whole life has gotten upside down, in elementary I was as happy as I could be, i only cared about my friends and one or two girls, in summary life was good.

In my first year of high school, I made friends with new people and lost a bit of contact with old ones, also a was at an all time low with my weight, I was with about 5kg of overweight, but as I wrote I was the happiest kid so I just didn't care, but as time passed I wanted to go back to my old friends, people started being mean and evil just to fit in.

Luckily for me, in my second year of high school I got a good class with one of my best friends from elementary, although he became way much popular and shit, he still hanged with me, in this year people started being even more mean and dickheads, in the second semester I was tired of insults and people, in the last month of that year I was so tired I almost ended it.

Entering my third year, my class was full of dickheads and I realized I needed to start losing weight, also since the past year a started drinking my home's alcohol and in parties. The first three months were hell, but as time passed I lost weight by swimming, also I started going out more with my old friends and the second part of the year was alright.

Right now Im going to start my fourth year of high school and although I have never been diagnosed with depression I feel as it comes back to hunt me sometimes in 2018, my desired to be high or drunk has increased, and I feel that my friends don't appreciate me as much as in the past, and as I see myself grow to become an adult, I really want to stay as a kid or be an adult, my teenage years have been pretty shitty, I still haven't kissed a girl, but at least I'm feeling way better than last year I guess",depression

"I'm at a loss, and I think I need to go back on medication. I'm still a youngin, 18 years old. I've been off of antidepressants for about 8 months now, and before then I was taking Trintellex which ended up not working out. My first medication was Zoloft, my body did not agree with its compounds so I tried Prozac. I found myself heaving over the toilet about twice a day on it. I've had a history with meds as well as psychiatrists, psychologists, and counsellors, but it was hard for me to find someone who fit. Throughout high school and middle school I've been back and forth from online and public school. When I was taking online courses at home, I got to know myself so much quicker than the people around me, and I guess that's due to independency early on. I actually ended up dropping out because of my mental health. I have been incapable of holding a job for longer than a few months because of this, other than previous work I had when I was younger. But I like to paint and write, and take photos on film. 

As of about three months ago, I've been unable to take care of myself in the simplest of ways, like eating, showering, and even getting out of the house most days. My depression & BPD is taking over my life entirely at this point. My poor mother has been aiding to my pain, and I guess she's been my caregiver. I feel like such a burden and major inconvenience to everyone around me and the ones who love me, and I think so much differently than them. My thoughts feel profound and significant, but I feel so alone with them. I'm often left with contemplations of ""is this really worth all the energy I am giving"" or wishing I was alone.

I got up and went to puke more, while I was puking she found the bottles in the trash. She starting crying and screaming at me. She took me to the nearest hospital while calling my step-brother in New Jersey. When we got in, she was asking for help. They put me in a room and hooked me up to an IV. Doctor asked me questions like what did I take and shit like that. They didn't have the equipment to help me, so they put me in an ambulance and shipped me off to a bigger hospital. The people that put me into the ambulance asked me why I did it, I just said I didn't want to live. They were quiet after that. I wasn't, I was puking my face off. When we got to the bigger hospital, I was put into a room, IV and other things hooked up to me, and just laid there with my mom sitting beside me.

Even a preacher came to meet me, asking me if I wanted to pray. I resisted telling him to fuck off and said no instead. They were going to put me in Suicide watch place but my mom wouldn't let them. Once I was okay to go home, we left and came home. I told my mom I was sorry and that was that. I was put with a psychologist who recommended I go back to school as quickly as possible, (wouldn't want anyone wondering what happened, would we) so I went back two days later. I only told one friend a month ago, he didn't react to much. Family members act as if nothing happened and I am fine now. I am sad and want to cry but I can't. I don't like myself. I am useless. I am trash. I just want to die.",depression
Advice for recent experience with depression. I've gradually been becoming more and more irritant and anxious about things but recently it all kind of hit the fan. I'd like to know what some of you do and thoughts you have that help you obtain some inner peace when in tough situations that you either don't have control over or have done all you can. Really appreciate it!,depression
"I know that I need to take medication to live, and knowing that makes me hate myself even more. I can't get over this mental hurdle. To me, it feels like relying on medication to function highlights a personal weakness. It's proof that I am inherently weaker than everyone around me, that I'm lesser than my peers. I resent the fact that I can't live properly without them and it makes me hate myself even more. It's been six years since I stopped taking my antidepressants (doctor approved), but now everything in my life is fucked up again and I know that I need to take medication again, but it just makes me feel so fucking angry and sad and weak and worthless. Why can't I just be strong like everyone else.",depression

"Anyone run away from things they actually want? Vaguely put, I know.  This can imply many things, like running away from people you actually want to be close with.

"How do you get out of your negative thought cycles? I'm 28M, and anxiety and depression have taken over my life. Some days I'm fine, other days I can't even think without breaking down into tears for seemingly no reason. I make excuses for my behavior, thinking 'people will think you're weak if you have depression'. I can't receive gifts without feeling worthless, like I shouldn't need help. I would give everything away if someone asked. I let people take advantage of me. I can never stand up for myself - it feels great when I FINALLY do, although it's only when I'm so drunk I regret it for weeks . I say thank you too much. I go days without food although I exercise. I interrupt people in mid-sentence because my anxiety to impress overpowers any hope of listening to anything they have to say. I make excuses for the way I act and self medicate with multiple substances, which I realize would be worse if I could afford them. I make plans with people then don't answer the phone when they call. Everyone around me seems to be happy and have a healthy level of narcissism. I don't. Tried SSRIs. Tried meditation. Tried therapy. Nothing works. It's like riding a bicycle just fast enough not to fall over. My negative thoughts over power any positive ones. I have too much pride to allow anyone to help me. I feel bad when they do. I know I need to save money, but spend it immediately. I try to help myself, but it always backfires in my own mind. Can last for hours, or weeks. My mind and behavior contradict themselves constantly. I just want to live my life the way I'm capable, but I end up a day late, dollar short, carrying a million excuses. I just wish I could be happy for an extended period of time, but I can't. So my question is, how do you get yourself out of negative and self deprecating thought cycles? I'm at a loss. ",depression
"Feigning social confidence leading to complete disgust and self-hatred when I'm alone. Just a warning, this is a rant and I'm not sure how cohesive my ideas are right now.

I'm currently in high school.  Based on some things I said/did early on, people generally disliked me because of my blatant cynicism and apathetic attitude. I was treated as ""the weird kid"", and I made very few friends.

Recently I've decided to open up socially, feign confidence and pretend not to give a fuck.  I've learned a convincing fake laugh and smile (the trick is to raise your eyebrows a little while doing it) and everyone who sees it appears to have begun to treat me as an enthusiastic, carefree person.

But it's making me go insane.  I find myself absolutely disgusted by anything and everyone, including myself.  There are times that I have literally had to refrain from saying ""Ew, what the fuck?"" out loud when I see people doing certain, provoking things that they think no one notices.  I practically become nauseous when I look at the Youtube homepage or trending videos to see what kind of cancer people find entertaining.  When I'm alone and I procrastinate for 10 minutes I'll slam the table and literally tell myself ""Fuck you, you're fucking gross, dude.""  My mental state is not good.  The only consistently uplifting emotion I experience is hope for my future, which I know won't last forever, especially once I fully realize how worthless I am in this state.

I connect with many on this subreddit about the effects of depression, but I feel like I'm different in the sense that I am not the victim. I brought this upon myself.

I don't mean for my general disgust for the world to come off as pretentious.  All I want is to be freed from this.  I want to be accepting of what I see, good or bad.  That goes for my own emotions as well–I want to understand them and accept them, instead of resenting myself for letting them spawn into my mind.

If anyone can relate to this, I'd be interested to hear your take on it.  I feel like my mental state is slipping out of my grasp and I just want some control over it.",depression

"Need help trying to get my dad moving again Hi all, trying to use some new resources and get some advice on a family situation.

My dad is in his early 70s and is retired from the business he owned.  He's been diagnosed with ""chronic fatigue/depression,"" which he's had a few bouts of at different points in his life.  The most recent bout, which started around five years ago, has lasted the longest and nothing seems to be working.  

For the majority of his life, my dad has been very active, whether it be outside gardening or working.  With this most recent bout, he's lost all of that and seems to only want to lay on the couch and watch TV all day.  We've tried psychiatrists, psychologists, medicine, and signing him up for classes, but nothing is breaking him out of it.    

My mom is still very active and also still works.  My dad lying around all day while my mom continues to work has put a big strain on their marriage.  My whole family also does not think it's good for my dad's mental or physical health to be just laying around all day.

We're all very frustrated and wondering if there's any strategies or other things that we've not tried.  If anyone has any ideas, please throw them out.

Thanks!",depression
"Bored senseless, feeling lost This might be a complete mess of words, so forgive me:

I've just finished grade 9, and I'm going into grade 10 after the summer.

I'm also switching schools, so I'll be in a completely new school in the new year.

Thing is, I'm not sure if this is hormones or whatever acting out on me, but I've recently felt like I couldn't enjoy anything.

I'm hella short for my age as well, (like 5'1 or something) which has led me to believe that there couldn't possibly be anyone who would be even slightly interested in being with me, be it now or years from now.

I've tried everything at this point: playing video games, binge-watching anime, sleeping... nothing has really worked.

To make matters worse, I feel like just telling my parents about how I feel will result in a disaster...

I've tried, and that's led to my mom telling me that I make her feel like a failiure, which usually leads to a full on fight...

Switching schools was an impossible choice to make, and the only thing that led to me choosing to leave was knowing that nothing would have changed had I stayed.

The last thing that I want to look like is an attention whore, so I've successfully managed to pretty much make everyone around me believe that I'm happy.

I'm hilariously insecure, and when I'm at school I can feel a strong feeling that nobody in my grade treats me like I'm even their same age.

I've managed to shed a bit of light on this to a small group of people in the school, but that really hasn't helped me a whole lot...

I don't even really know now. I've done a bit of googling on this, and almost every time I google my feelings I end up with this word: ""Anhedonia: the inability to feel pleasure.""

I've tried telling my parents about this, but I always get replied to with a ""You think your life is hard?"" or a very blatant smack on the face, telling me that nobody believes that young people can even comprehend what mental illness is.

I...I don't know. 

A part of me longs to just have a friend that can listen to me on all of this, and just... understand. Somebody that I can confide in, somebody that I know will comfort me.

I'm not sure if everyone else is with me, or if I'm just an anomaly, but I seem to find that almost everyone my age seems to be drowned in this... superficiality? 

Most people in my grade seem to see nothing more than music, rap, etc... and they seem to be so into it. 

Then there are others, who are very obviously depressed, have cut scars on their wrists, regularly see the counselor, etc... I find that no counselor seems to be able to help with anything at all.

This is kinda all over the place, sorry :(

to pretty much summarize all of this, I've found that thinking about any of these things will lead me into a very sensitive mood, which will lead to me bursting into tears if somebody gives me a hug.

If you're still reading this, I just want to thank you for listening to this mess of a post.

It really helps to know that somebody hears me. :)",depression

"Should I give electroconvulsive therapy a try? Been depressed and anxious for a very very long time.  It's been about 3 1/2 years of really hitting it hard, trying to find something that helps, to no avail.  Therapy has failed with 4 different therapists.  Medications have failed.  I've lost track on how many I've tried.  I've tried exercising more and eating better, no change at all.  My psychiatrist is at a loss.  He's recommended Electroconvulsive therapy.  My insurance covers it and all.  I'm just nervous to try it.  I'm honestly just tired of treatment.  I wonder if I'd be better off just being left alone.

Part of my problem with that is I'm currently on disability, and I'm afraid they'll cut me off if I'm not constantly seeking treatment.  To me it's like I'll never be above a 5/10.  At best I think I might be able to be OKAY waking up everyday with what little I have.  But while going through the stresses of treatment, I won't be higher than maybe a 3 or 4.

"I've been finally feeling good for the past 3 days. Maybe it's just the weekend that was nice, however I haven't felt so nice in the past year or even more.

"Don't know where else to turn too Sorry I know this is like reading a novel but if one of you can help it would mean sm to me

I started feeling this way about a year ago. It just suddenly came over me that my life is pointless, and I'm in a constant pursuit of something I will never have. Luckily this feeling subdued for a brief period of time when I worked at a summer camp. Working with children is about the only thing that feels remotely fulfilling and my coworkers were so nice and caring for the first time I had felt truly apart of something. Even during it I still felt that depressive state, like it was calling to me wondering where I had been. Instead of being around constantly it would come back in anxiety attacks mostly when I was by myself constantly reminding me of how worthless I am and how this summer feeling is only a delay to my problem. Once school started it came rushing back. That was until she came into my life. I guess I'll call her Bailey, so Bailey was in my gym class (she's a senior, I'm a junior) and for the first quarter I didn't really talk to her or even really notice her I just thought she was pretty but didn't really think much of her. But then around early November we got assigned to work in a group together and we kinda hit it off. I knew she wasn't popular in her grade but I didn't care cause to me she looked beautiful and all my ""friends"" thought she was too so I began to get attached to her knowing no one would care that she wasn't really popular. ( I feel like it's important to note that my high school is absurdly cliquey, that's why popularity is so important at my school, I fucking hate that is, but that's why I'm talking so much about it and also I would consider myself relatively popular but I have a big * attached to my name cause I had the douche bag label attached to me due to a nasty rumor and got me kicked out of my friend group and also prevented me from ever getting close to or even really talking to a girl again, so it's another reason why i got so attached) but once the group thing ended we hit an awkward spot. We added each other on sc and snapped each other non stop but it was weird cause in school we didn't talk to each other at all, because we were both to nervous to start conversation. But one day I finally worked up the courage and did, and I remember her face lit up and how happy she looked that I finally ended the awkward silence. I remember how ecstatic I was , finally no more pointlessness. I finally found someone who was beautiful, funny, smart, and above all genuine. There was a dance coming up soon and I remember being so scared about whether to ask her or not. I didn't want to risk her saying no and not being able to take her to junior prom (which was months away but she had been the only girl I had really talked to in years at school). But the day before I told myself that I would ask her she asked me to the dance and I hit a new high. Not only was it great for myself but my mom had always wanted a son she could give relationship advice too and talk about gfs and dances, so she was always confused by the fact that I never had any because as far as she could tell I was an athletic popular guy. So not only did it feel like an end to the purposelessness in my life, but it felt so relieving to finally give my mom the son she deserved. So ofc I finally had something to be proud of I pretty much shouted for all the school to hear that I finally had a date to a dance and she was beautiful and perfect. But at this time the red flags started to appear, I remember whenever I asked one of my ""friends"" about her in her grade they would always give the same response ""Oh I used to be best friends with her"" and they would never give a reason why they stopped being friends,just that they used to be, I was also told about how she supposedly scratched her ex bfs face and smashed his phone, but figuring she had already heard the rumors about me I told myself to ignore it because she had probably done the same for me. At this same time she told me something that made me really connect with her, she told me her life was so boring and how it seemed like the same process everyday with her not hanging out with anyone and just working on school work, so to me this sounded like she may have had that same feeling I had, so I told her if she ever wanted to do anything at all I was down. (Btw we had never hung out outside of school) So she said she would ""probably have to take me up on that offer sometime"" and once again that ecstasy flooded my mind. Now since it was clear that she was hurt whenever I hung out with friends and she was by herself so I stopped hanging out with my friends( this would have broken any normal friendship but that why I called them my ""friends"") and then it happened. Finally she hung out with one of her friends, I didn't know much about her friend but she always seemed like a cunt to me ig I'll call her Jennifer. So it's going normal Bailey is snapping me pics because Jennifer's definitely on her phone scing away. But then Bailey sends me one and it's convo with some guy (who didn't go to our school) on Jennifer's phone and this guy is calling Bailey cute and asking Jennifer how old she is. So I'm extremely confused because Bailey has to know I have feelings for her and Ik we weren't dating but why would she send that to me? So I try to play it off like nothing happened but then like two snaps later she sends me one saying ""this bitch (Jennifer) just invited me on a double date with two random guys"" So I'm like wtf and immediately assume she's going on the double date, so I'm heartbroken. And don't respond (which we never left each other on open) so she responds and says ""wow can't believe you just left me on open"" which still heartbroken I leave on open. Then as those thoughts entered my mind like a tsunami , a final ray of hope shined in and thought maybe she didn't mean she was actually going on that double date. So I ask her if she is going on it and she says idk it was just a fun thing so I ignore the fact that she might be going and just apologize so she says ""it's whatever"" and then about 20 minutes later I get an ig request from Jennifer and then 20 minutes later my nightmare happens. Bailey sends me a txt and says ""this was a mistake I don't want to go to the dance with u anymore"" my heart shatters and tears blur my vision. I get on my hands and knees and beg her, I confess my depression, I tell her she's my only reason and how suicidal I was before she entered my life. She overwhelmed says ""I'll give you another chance under one condition that we both get to know each other before we assume things about one another"" So I agree and put forth my own condition saying ""I don't want you to take me back just because I'm suicidal"" she lies and says ""No I'm going with u because your a good person and I genuinely want to"" (little did I know she was soon going to break both those rules) after that things went oddly back to normal.  That was until the nightmare returned again she left me on opened which was extremely odd cause she had flipped out on me for doing it to her (also this entire she is hanging out with Jennifer's friend group more and more). So after three days go by of the same thing of nothing but streaks and no talking to each other, the thoughts invade my mind and I decide to finally confess my deepest shame. I went to the school psychologist and she said my thoughts were ""concerning""  and told my mother who couldn't stop crying once she heard, and who then took me to a psychiatric office where I told my story once more. They recommend out-patient therapy 3 times a week but since my insurance was a problem it was going to be about week before it could start. I told Bailey everything that happened she said she was sorry and that she wasn't having the best week herself and that understandably she didn't feel like she should have to check in. But things went back to normal for about two days and then the week of the dance she cut me off once again. But I kept telling myself I would make it up at the dance. But then the nightmare came back for its final time, I got a txt after she was with Jennifer at lunch saying that she heard I was bragging about going to a senior party, she said that she never game me permission and that it's her friend group and that their not letting anyone in ( that line always stuck out to me) so I was like wtf I hadn't been and why would I I'm not 12 I don't brag about hanging out with older kids and nonetheless ones who are only a year older. But she only says k. So we get into a bit of an argument and ask her why she is so adamant about hurting me? And then she keeps saying because we're friends as if that word is synonymous with disposable. So then this argument continues to when she's out with Jennifer and she tells me her friends don't want me to go with her because ""they know she can't have fun when she's around me"" and then she tells me that i forced her into this, then she tells me  she doesn't know if she wants to go with anymore. So I tell her well that's something I need to know, she says I guess not. I don't respond. She sends me a million messages thinking I just went off to kms, then Jennifer tries to play the hero and sends me an ig direct saying that everyone's life sucks and that I should just get over it and also that her bf killed himself so I shouldn't. I debate if I should kms or not. I quickly come up with a plan to a sneak a knife out and slit my throat in the woods, but then I think have I ever tried any treatment for my depression. I remember that movie ordinary people and think maybe a mental hospital will actually help. So with nothing to lose I tell my mom everything she calls a crisis hotline and they recommend a mental hospital. I try to txt Bailey telling her that I'm going to a hospital but she thinking I just went to kms (also when she thought I had went to kms she kept sending me txts saying how could I do this to her on this night) sees me typing and thinks I faked it all and tells me to never fucking talk to her again, so with nothing to lose I decide to post it to my story thinking I'm gonna be gone for a while so why  let people wonder and just tell them the sad truth instead. So rushed to the er and on Friday night the night of the dance I spent my first night in a mental hospital. My time there was relatively peaceful but as I always thought it was nothing but delay, all they taught was meaningless distractions. The only helpful thing was talking with the shrink. All the advice I got was she's a bitch get over her. So I was discharged and I immediately thought of her. I checked ig and sure enough she had went to the dance and ofc had ""a great time with her besties"" but I was just so happy she hadn't went with a different guy. So I txted her just saying hey. She said she was sorry for everything she had done. And we ended up restarting our streak but the thing is she started doing what we used to do and we snapped each other back and forth constantly and with that my mind rushed to maybe just maybe I can still go to junior prom with her. But she couldn't  keep up the lie forever and she started leaving me on delivered and would respond when she felt like. But now I'm in sm of a worse place. She has gotten everything she wanted. I found out that she had been asking this guy Derek (who's in the friend group) for a ride home all the time idk if this started while I was in the hospital or before it. It hurts sm to see her with him they do everything together just like I wanted to do with her. What makes it worse he's genuinely not a good person, he's dumb he was in my Spanish 2 class last year and I went to a school hockey with some of my ""friends"" (him and Bailey ended up sitting right behind me) and the entire he tried to act like he was one of those drunk college fans, so he constantly yelled like an idiot at the players and refs well Bailey tried to act like she found it as funny as he did. But lately I haven't been feeling anything expect pure rage and heartbreak. I had a meeting with my new psychologist so I was ready to confess my thoughts but she said she's more family oriented so she wants my mother in the room for what should be my individual therapy. I can't help but think Bailey won. She stepped all over me and won. She's finally in a friend group and now she has a bf who has no depression, has no mind, only wants to get drunk and act like he's one of guys more popular and athletic than him. And this has left me so fucking numb. I don't feel anything I hangout with my friends just because I can't kms when I'm with them, everything is just to avoid those thoughts. I started cutting ( not with a knife my parents locked those up so I use the edge of a nail clipper so it's kindve like intense scratching ig) just because it's the only thing that feels like something. And every time I muster the strength to just think of Camp, Bailey starts a conversation with me only to end it half way through. I'm now cutting myself every single time something wrong happens. I feel khal Drogo in got I'm suppose to be dead but I'm only kept alive because people tell me they can't let me commit suicide. I want to tell her so bad all the pain she caused me, but I don't see how it will change anything. I think she'll see if I kms , solving all my problems, but she won't she'll get even more attention and can use that as even more of a reason to hang out with her friend group. I tried to show her i self harm (when i started, hopping she or really anyone (I flashed it to the school psychologist but she didn't notice))would tell me to stop and I'm pretty sure she did notice and didn't care. So that's why I'm posting this I just don't know what else to do.

"I think I have depression. What should I do? It started with me quitting math. (I'm homeschooled, by the way). I figured math didn't have any applications in the real world past basic algebra. Then I quit all the other subjects, too. I started becoming lazier, only doing the easiest chores and trying to find a way out of the harder ones. Now I barely do any chores at all. I was on the computer all the time, making music and playing video games. Then even those activities, my favorite things to do, became boring, I just mindlessly drifted from YouTube video to YouTube video. I was lying in bed just now thinking of things to do tomorrow, and dismissing all of them, since I just don't have the motivation. I don't feel motivated to do even my favorite activities anymore, I barely eat (I've been eating a little more now, I've taken notice of how little I'm eating and making myself eat more), I don't take care of my hygiene, and we've just moved to a new house so I don't really have any friends to talk to, even through email, since I always forget to check my emails. Looking at all the other posts I feel like I have life good, and that I'm making all the other people with actual depression look petty. But I really want some advice, I want to have the motivation to do my favorite hobbies again... I don't know what to do...

"Emotional atrophy. For a long time I've tried to convince myself that I don't feel a whole lot and if I don't feel a whole lot what's the point to expressing it. The reality is that this is a learned behaviour. A behaviour which very nearly cost me the relationship I'm in. I'm not the type of person to blame to psychic pain on the short comings of my parents. I just feel that it's a cop out. In the same breath I am learning to come to terms with the fact that having been raised by a narcissist has left hooks in me in a deeper manifestation that I ever would have been conscious of on my own. It was never that I didn't feel a lot, it was I learned to hide my feelings for fear of setting her off. Over time that fear caused my ability to express emotion to atrophy. 
 I'm currently in the process of teaching myself again that it's okay to have feelings. That not everyone out there is going to use any sort of deviation from the norm as fuel to break you down. To make you submit. Some people actually just want the best for you. 
By no means is this a comfortable process. I actually detest the process but the immediate benefits already seem innumerable.

Best friends said nothing so far, and I actually had to remind one of them....

'Why did you quit school' - Grandma. Stressing.

"I've lost all sense of myself (please don't read if you are on the precipice of The End, I beg of you). I'm starting to toy around with the idea of just cutting off everyone I know in my life permanently. No friends, no family.

I make absolutely no effort to create any kind of relationship at all. No friends. No romantic interests.

I've stopped doing my makeup (which doesn't sound big but for me it is because it's part of my identity and it's how I actually feel like myself).

I'm learning to train myself to subdue and eliminate any sexual desire or urges or any desire for romanticism and companionship to quell my loneliness and become one with it.

All I want is to disappear. Forever. And nobody will ever notice. Nobody will ask questions. Nobody will care. Nobody will ever even remember my name.

Everything just seems pointless. Meaningless. Everything in life, everything we ever do or or experience is ephemeral. Friends come and go. Family pass on or move away. Love is fickle and difficult and fleeting. I am nothing or no one special. I have no real place in this world. In the end, we all die alone.

So what's the point? (This is a rhetorical question. I've already decided what the ""meaning of life is"" from my own perspective). I'm reaching the point to where, despite all my self reflection, I still can't hold to my own addages.

I'm breaking. I've no desire to fix myself, temporarily or permanently. All I hope for is a quick death. Or that maybe my disassociatve actions prevail and I can finally just disappear.",depression

"Really Need to Vent I have a lot of anxiety issues and attacks that always occur to me. Every day they seem to get worse and worse as the world seems to get worse and worse. To be honest, the only reason I am even alive today is because of the concepts of Safe Spaces, and even Scumfucks on the internet are trying to get those completely removed to complete their selfish desires. And they are actually suceeding with it which is the most fucked up thing, look at that reactionary uni in Chicago, so don't tell me these dickheads don't mean shit.

"I Don't Know How to be Happy Lately everything seems to be falling apart. I've hated every job I've ever had, and I always feel like my coworkers and bosses think I'm a clueless child. But, I can't quit because I'm broke and know that working isn't an option and has to be done to survive.

My marriage is falling apart and I've only been married for a few months, but me and my husband only ever seem to be angry with each other. Whenever either of us is upset, it seems like we attack each other instead of the problem. I struggle with telling him why I'm upset because whenever I explain myself it feels like my feelings don't matter to him. I don't want to end it, and I worked so hard for this to even be a reality in the first place, but I feel like nothing ever gets better. Failure isn't an option, though, and it can't end.

I need to learn to communicate better, I know that, but I don't know if I know how. I constantly stress out over every little thing, I burn out quickly in social situations, every bad feeling is amplified and I break down a lot, and I honestly feel like I don't know how to be happy. I feel like a naive little kid who thought getting married to my best friend would fix everything. Not in the sense that it would be perfect, I just thought I had finally found someone I could trust.

"SSRI problems (Zoloft/Sertraline) x-post from r/anxiety So I've been taking Zoloft for several months and it has been working well for anxiety/depression but I'm having some problems with it.  The biggest problem is that my mind feels blank a majority of the time.  When conversing with other people sometimes I feel as if I have nothing to say.  I feel as if I am less witty, and also less creative.  I've backed down my dosage from 100mg to 50mg with some success as I don't feel as 'spaced out'.  I am now backing down to 25mg to see if I feel any better.  I guess I'm posting here to see if anyone else has had similiar problems and if so what have you done.  Zoloft works great for anxiety (panic attacks, general feeling of dread), and also works well for depression, but I feel like I've lost some of my personality, my creativity, and wit.

"Exercise advice for someone with anxiety & depression who's ruined their physique? I know this might not be the best subreddit to ask, but I'd rather have support of people who understand, than PTs and healthy people who might not...

So I've been moderately depressed for a couple of years, but after moving to a different country for my SO my depression has gone through the roof. I won't go into details, however...

It has caused me to over\-eat a little, and I rarely leave the house because I have no friends to meet, no job to go to, plus my depression and social anxiety doesn't really help me get out ""just because"" either...

As a result, I've gained a lot of weight and it feels like my muscles are very limited \- if ""non existent"". I am deeply ashamed and it brings me even further down into depression. I try to take walks but my calves, ankles and feet hurt so badly after a few minutes, so I walk in pain looking like a moron because my muscles ache and start to get stiff and weird. 

Now I have managed to apply for a new job and I might move back to my home country if I get it \- so I want to be able to move around a bit without aching, sobbing and being so incredibly ashamed of myself.

Any advice? Besides ""suck it up""? I don't have access to a bike or a gym. I wish I could take forest walks because the ground is not as hard as asphalt, but I live in a city. ",depression
"I Just Realized Why I Have No Friends The obvious answer? Depression and a lack of social skills. But the bigger reason is that I have no love in me. Since childhood, I've always been told by my family that I'm ""not the most caring person"" or something to the effect of ""you're a cold-hearted loser"". Honestly, I never realized how little genuine affection I've felt for the people in my life. Maybe I did feel it, but apparently I'm terrible at showing it, and have been all my life. It's pretty much always been to the point where if I show I cared emotionally about something they would react with surprise. This increased my social anxiety as I ""learned"" my affection would not just be normally accepted like other's would be. I'm 21 now and at the lowest, loneliest point I've ever been. 

When I was in high school I decided I wanted to be a psychiatrist because psychology piqued my interest. When I told my family, they laughed it off because ""there was no way I coud care enough about people's problems to do the job"". And maybe they're right. Maybe the reason I can't truly connect with other people is that I don't actually care about them. I can tell myself I do and force myself to socialize, but it naturally leads nowhere because I can't intuitively care enough about the interaction or the other person for it to be fruitful. They say knowing the problem is the first step to solving it, but honestly, it just makes me feel more depressed. More like I really am truly broken somehow, or different enough to where I can't socially thrive. I'm alone because of who I am, I can't change because I'm depressed, and I'm depressed because I'm alone. What a life.",depression

"Struggling with depression and exams and adverse cognitive effects I have always been struggling with depression, but the advent of exams seems to be making it worse.

Insofar, I have been studying for my exams, but I have only recently begun to show unreasonable amounts of anxieties (due to my already dormant anxieties), self-doubt, and thoughts that question my very cognitive functions and ability to learn. I have begun to lose hope and control of myself.

And as for now, it feels that I have questioned myself so much on my cognitive abilities that it isn't easy for me to sit and learn in class or concentrate in tasks as easily as it was before; I just can't focus that well on extended reading and hyped-up concentrating nor can I remember and learn anything new. I also get sleepless nights and worries.

In spite of that, I still keep trying to study, and would take hours just to read every word of a single short paragraph from my study guide so as not to fail for my awaiting exams.

This only increases my anxieties as I live on day by day, not only for I have my exams, but also for I feel as if my cognitive ability is gone permanently and it's deep in my brain that I will no longer be that smart student people once loved ever again.

"People around me realised my anxiety and sadness and it has made me feel really vulnerable I don't like being a negative person ever. At school My house mistress said something that was really personal to me the other day and it got to me really bad and made me view my life differently. She targeted my stress levels and anxiety and it made me feel shit about myself. I confronted her and she said that she was sorry which was nice. But then she said you need to see the school councillor because it's not normal. I was balling my eyes out this whole time, and she was really supportive and I told her that I hate feeling like this. It just made me feel so vulnerable that people notice. Then my tutor told me people were worried about me this same day. He said that my teacher who gave me a test back that I was upset about the other day was worried. Then another teacher who I went to go see that day made me sit down with him for half an hour saying how someone mentioned me in a conversation and asked me if I was okay. I am grateful for all the support my school is given me, I just feel very self conscious like people know stuff about me that I don't want to. And then my best friend went up to my house mistress and said that she felt helpless like she couldn't help me because I was so upset.  Which I don't mind but just makes me feel wierd. I can't explain it. I don't want people to see me break I want to look and feel happy on the surface. Becuase I hate the embarrassment when I build up things so much that I just burst and can't cope and it looks irrational. 
Only my best friend knows about all the teachers saying this to me. I am not telling anyone I am getting counselling because I don't want to be attention seeking or negative. I thought I could cope with life but it looks like that I don't at all which full on freaks me out. It scares me that I have anxiety that is out of my control and depressing thoughts that control me. I am scared I will start pushing people away and I am petrified. 
I am now seeing a counsellor next week and my teacher is going to have another meeting with me. I kinda just want to talk to my teacher because he knows me and I feel more relaxed with him. All in all I hate this right now and don't want anyone to know how dark I am feeling and it scares me that so many people now know.

"Depressed and taking the job? I got to get something off of my chest and it's nagging me since a few days and denies me getting any rest. 

I'll maybe soon start a job as Software Architect. My commute will be 1 1/2 hours to 2 hours and I need to switch train 3 times. Which means a lot of delays and missed transition trains because of other delays. I'll lose 3 to 5 hours each day plus the usual 8 hour + overtime a day. 

I worked hard to get the chance to be in the final interview level and my future boss told me it's very likely they take me if I ever reach that step. 

The work will be hard learning coding as someone who's only average good at coding. I can't stand stress at all and will have to use public transport a lot, work long, commute long, learn a lot till my brain hurts. My new boss demands me learning in my free time as well to be of use quickly. All for a below average earning in that field. :/ 

But what's the alternative option? I'm unemployed since over half a year by now and the gab is only growing bigger. I'm not sure if I should take the job as my depression denies me any way to tell if it's the right thing. My colleagues seam to be nice in a nice work environment, so there's at least that.

"Just need to vent. Not sure if this is the best place for it but right now I am depressed I have been having a lot of issues lately and its getting to the point that I am officially depressed for a little while now. The quick version is I keep working myself to death both for my job and my family and I constantly feel like I'm not doing enough because I'm just getting farther and farther behind.

Each individual issue isn't a big deal and normally wouldnt bug me but for the past 2 years with a large group of people nagging on top of it all that I think about is the stuff not getting done or other failures.

Lately my brain is very hard to control. If I'm not listenning to a podcast or an audio book and the background thinking gets a second to itself, it just takes off. Something simple like shit I wasnt able to mow my yard and my dad did it instead suddenly becomes a spreadsheet of me constantly messing up and not able to keep up with anything. 

And then on top of all of this responsibility that I'm drowning in, my group of friends is quickly shrinking. I had 4 small groups with differwnt interests and interactions. But with all of my ""sorry not this time"" or ""I cant afford to time wise"" we have drifted apart and I flat out not in the group anymore. I only have one group left but it seems that all I can talk to them about is tabletop rpgs. If I go too far off track I can feel them course correct back to the game. 

What's really bad is when I'm hitting on my wife and get turned down or flat out ""hell no"" and my brain goes nuts. Thinking that she is cheating or not interested or that I simply not good enough for her. I know what the corrwct answer is but every time my brain just goes nuts. 


Now I know a lot of this isnt depression. My problem is that this stuff has been going on so long now that I get into a rut where I don't care and when I notice I'm in the rut it just upsets me more. Kind of stuff like not brushing my teeth every day, or even shower every day, shave, or clean up my hair and I dont do it because I just don't care and I feel like I'm putting that time to catching up on stuff. Anyone with 2 cents knows that that probably isnt true. Either way I can no longer motivate myself and when I vent to my wife she gets defensive because she thinks I'm teying to blame whenever I'm just trying to get stuff organized. 

I dont know what to do anymore my big thing is time. I work 9hr days, 6 days a week and the job is about on hour away so I loose just over 11 hrs a day for just work, then I have a newborn at home that I have to take care of as well as simply trying to stay on top of chores.

I escaped to Japan for a year to study abroad, but even there I changed families 8 times and I was constantly being bullied in school.

I feel like I'm just wandering from one thing to the next, one avenue to the next hoping that something will fill my heart with passion and excitement.

A few years ago, I decided to open myself up to new experiences and try anything and everything. I got involved with different social causes, clubs, activities, forms of art, nightlife, volunteer positions... I travelled to places that were outside my comfort zone --- but none of that made an impact on me.

I was ""living life"" and exposing myself to new things, but nothing spoke to me. It felt like I was doing things just for the sake of doing them, not because I was driven or full of passion or motivated to do them.

"SUDDEN (provoked) terrible depressive episode (possible trigger warning?) Hey,

I've had anxiety (GAD) and depression for (at least) 15 years now. I was diagnosed then (when I was around 20), and I've been 'struggling' with it on and off for the entire time. I had to leave school about 6 years ago and finally went back 3 years ago. I have an exam today which shouldn't be this big of a deal but now all I can think about is (trigger warning) suicide. (Sorry I don't know the rules here about trigger warnings and don't want to bother anyone). Like constantly, I woke up wanted to hurt myself and it hasn't stopped and I can't make the thoughts stop. My exam is in 2 hours and I don't think I can make it into it... I don't think it would be smart either. I'm in that place where I can't trust my own thoughts and I don't know what do. I

​

As the title says, this has been a ridiculously 'powerful' depressive episode. I kind of feel it taking a hold of me... I have dealt with this stuff before but usually I can see it coming at least a little. I just don't know what to do... 

​

Relevant info:

1. I am seeing a therapist (I should probably call her, I know)
2. I am taking Prozac 60 mg for anxiety/depression
3. I have clonazepam and xanax at my disposal. I actually just took 2 mg (which is 'a lot') of xanax bc I couldn't stop shaking when I woke up from the non stop stream of 'dangerous' thoughts. (I should note it's a 'safe' amount for me, I've taken this much before, so it wasn't with any ill-intent, i'm just trying to calm my mind.

vent: I just want this to be over (not life)... I've been dealing with this for so long. I just... I'm just exhausted and it's just too much on top of school and work and life... I've been working really hard in therapy for the past 10 years and I don't know what to do. I'm sorry. I'm so very sorry. I feel lost. I hope this is ok to post. I always screw up stupid reddit rules (not in this sub) and get flagged for something. Anyway, god bless and I hope you are feeling as well as you can.",depression
"I don't know what to do anymore I feel like everything is going wrong. I have 2 kids that need so much and I feel like I cant provide for them. My older one keeps asking about her dad and he won't return my calls even when I let them leave voice mails.  My bf won't help me with them because they're not his. I get that. I don't expect him to but last night he basically said he was tired of them and we broke up. I can't be with someone that doesn't want my kids. 
We had a wreck a few months ago and since then I've been without car seats for them. I've finally got enough for one but which one do I get? Do I just keep saving til I can get both?
I work and clean and sleep that's it I don't get to play with my kids or even have a bath to relax. 
I'm so burnt out I'm ready to give up. I don't know if I can walk anymore I'm so exhausted.
I hope this kind of post is okay. I just feel hopeless and needed to let it out. 


Edit: and now I found out I have a tooth abscess.",depression
"I slept for 14 hours and spent the rest of the day in bed. How can I stop doing this. My depressive episodes are often characterized with extreme hypersomnia. For about a month now I've been struggling to get up from bed. I can easily spend over 12 hours a day sleeping, neglecting all my tasks.

I live alone in an apartment in Japan, away from family and friends, which makes it hard to get help.

Dont be giving me the bullshit saying theres people out there that loves. I will KNOW if they actually love me, but no one truly loves me. No one is out there willing to give their life for me. I feel no true, genuine feelings from my family. I see myself as a sad, stranded dog out in the woods shivering....looking for a friend...true love and care from someone. I see myself being walked past by, ignored. I didnt have actual friends growing up. I felt excluded no matter where i moved. Everywhere i lived i felt excluded, ignored, useless. I felt like i could have been a great friend, but no one gave me a chance to show that. I also felt like i had no identify and questioned myself. Who am i? Why am i here? Am i a girl in a guys body? I gave up at age 14. I blocked everyone from my life. From age 14-18 all i did was go to school, come home n eat eat eat so i got fat. Age 18 was when i became interested in suicide. Every night before bed, i would read suicide notes m written by other people until i fell asleep. Where was my familys love and support this whole time? No where. I grew up by myself. I have no identity. How can u let ur child become the way he did. Im 21 now and still the same but in another body i made for myself. This is body #2. Fit.  I call it Sung.  Body #1 was Paul and it was big, and chubby. Family and friend situations the same. Still cant identify myself. I am looking for something new. And that may be death. I never saw myself living last 23 honestly. I never saw myself living past my 80yr old grandma. I think i was here to live 18 years and kill myself, but i made a mistake and delayed it til now(3yrs). I told my sister same thing that i see myself live past 23, and i just told her again now.  Doctor checked my balls and said i might have herpes. I only am living cus i wanna have a son in the future because i feel like thatll be someone thatll i can truly feel love with, but having herpes risks me having a healthy son i can give a good life too. If i get the test back positive for herpes or incurable STDS i will probably kill myself finally.  Im only doing this for a son. If no healthy son, no use for me to continue living.

"Always Contradicting I'm always so annoyed at myself because on one hand I would like to have close friends, people I can rely on, people who appreciate me, all that good stuff.

But it's like I want to disappear but I'm always so selfish so I always come back and while it's really nice when I'm talking to them these thoughts come creeping back and I'm left like this again. I also have these contradicting thoughts about everything including getting help. I want people to notice I'm not okay and ask how I am and shit but when they do I'll always tell them ""I'm doing good, just tired/busy/whatever"" It's just like all this is just my fault. It's like I just want to feel like this so I can feel sorry for myself or whatever. I'm just so done. With myself. With everything.",depression

I think its safe to say it's the first time I've ever been betrayed like that. I wish things would get easier and I could just move on but there's a part of me that can't for some reason. I try to keep my head up but I am always reminded of her and it kills me because when I am reminded of her I start to think back to all the great times we had together and I lose it. It makes me wonder if I'll find anyone else in my future.,depression

"Feels like I'm hitting a new low every day. It all started about 4 years ago when my grandfather died. He was my closest grandparent, and sometimes even closer than my siblings. He died of (leukemia) cancer at the age of 79. I didn't sleep, I over ate, my family became divided after this, he was the joy of the family. Now it was a gloomy, depressed family. 2 years later, most of the family has recovered enough to function daily without thinking about it. That is when my dog, who I grew up with my whole life, passed away from cancer as well. He is what helped me get threw the deaths of my grandfather, and all of the bad days, and nightmares, and bullies at school afterwards. I cried more than twice every week, I had breakdowns every so often. I start to recover after some months, we get a new dog, happy little guy. A couple weeks later it turns out he has canine distemper (a life-threatening disease). All of this shit happens and I begin to develop an eating disorder with most of my family, rarely eating at home, and eating fast food most nights a week, I become overweight, than really overweight, I am about 40 pounds overweight now. And the bullying happens at school also. I get bullied for looking fat and looking like a ""Jew""(Big nose), -witz name. I turn to the food, and the internet to distract myself. It seems like I'm in a lottery of just fucking losing. A game that's rigged against me. Nobody gets married, nobody gets born, nobody graduates, nobody asks me to be their friend. Instead people get divorced, and die of cancer, and drop out, and call me out for being fat. It feels like most of it stems from me, being a shitty person, with no self control. I want to make better habits, but I have nowhere to start, I just want some advice from anybody who has any sort of relation to this, of what to do to change my life for the better, at least a little bit.",depression
"Must get through, please help! What did you do to climb out of this rut called ""depression?"" I [19 M] used to be motivated about learning, people, and the world. Finished high school as a valedictorian last year, opened a cleaning company for my mother and gained several clients. Earned enough money and bought a brand new Jeep (credit of course but paid half of it out). Then I got interested in architecture and worked as a designer for a construction company, making building plans and kitchen designs during past summer. Started college, got in for free with help of scholarships, and was happy studying biology and making friends for a few weeks. But, then I got depressed around November  for no reason and started low scoring in several of my classes, which never happened before. 

I barely made it through to the second semester by studying hard. Perhaps my depression briefly went away. As a result, I stopped hanging out with my friends and going to the gym. I gained 30 pounds and it's sick to look in the mirror knowing that that lard hill used to be a six pack. Right now I don't know what to do. I feel careless as if I don't give a fuck about anything, especially myself. I keep failing my college work and hate myself for that. Frequently I started waking up at night in cold sweat from nightmares where I find myself as a hobo scavenging a dumpster.
My mother recently inquired why I look sad and don't do my homework. I, being honest, confessed that I am depressed and I don't know why. Well, she got angry and said that she raised a lazy, undisciplined, fuck. 

My retired stepdad has collected several guns ( pistols, rifles, shotguns) which are stored in my bedroom, in a beautiful gun cabinet with glass frames. Every Friday evening, when nobody's home I take out .45 magnum and hold it up against my head and squeeze the trigger several times, but I never have the guts to load it. 

Everything just seems bleak, as if all the colors went away and I have no more joy from living. If you can help me I would appreciate your tips and advice on how I could get out of this fucking rut. I know there must be a way out I just can't put my finger on it.

"[throwaway] need some guidance. Hey guys, I made a throwaway a few days ago thinking that I'm ready to post about what I've been dealing with. I finally mustered up the guts to admit that I'm not happy. I don't know if it's depression, since I have never seen a professional about it. All I know is that I'm a 24 yr old female who is extremely not happy with her life. I don't want to say that I feel intense emotions about the state of life, I think it's more of a pit in my chest feeling. I get mad and sad easily but happiness and joy are basically foreign emotions to me at this point. I exercise  to try to get endorphins flowing, hang out with friends, watch my favorite shows.. I try to make myself happy. Sometimes it works, when I'm with friends I laugh and crack jokes but the moment I leave them it's back to that empty shell of a person feeling again. I am completely lost and don't know what to do anymore.. and the feeling of dread keeps getting worse each day. Recently I had thoughts of what it would be like if I wasn't around at all and it made me sad. Mostly because I feel like I'm wasting a life that someone else could've made so much with if they weren't such a Debby downer all the time. What do I do? ",depression

"How to deal with friends and people who are being neglectful? Don't you think it is most-frustrating when people just choose to ignore you? The people you've spent thousands of hours with ultimately don't care about you enough (or at least, in a way that shows that they do)?

​

I work from home as a writer/blogger, and I have to get my work approved before starting it. I get notified via social network if green-lighted, but increasingly those people don't even have the courtesy to tell me if it's not. Would a ""skip"" (their normal reply, jbtw) be a bit too much?

​

Similar is the case with my friends (even my best friend). If, for instance, I initiate plans to hang out, I don't even get a reply if they are not up for it. Is that too much to ask if the answer is not in the affirmative? And yet, online they are, as evident by their newsfeed and comments. Just not ready to reply. 

​

I do wonder, sometimes, if I have made myself almost too accessible in the past. Being always available for hanging out may have had some consequences (you can't help yourself if you have had a lonely childhood). These one-sided relationships and convos can become a bit too much, sometimes, especially if you have a bit of social anxiety and are a bit depressive.

"What if your depression makes sense, what if it isn't anything wrong with you on a biological level, and what if you can change how you feel? I think we often take the chemical imbalance explanation as truth a little too easily. In actual fact, when I look at my life it makes absolute sense why I'm depressed. Take Maslow's hierarchy of needs for example. Look at how your life is in each of these categories and see if your situation is a breeding ground for depression.

**1. Physiological**
This is the basic requirements for you to exist. Shelter, food, water, warmth, rest. 

I think most of us will be okay in this regard. I'm fine on a physiological level.

**2. Security**
This is your need for security and safety. Do you feel secure and safe in your day to day life?

This is where things begin to crumble slightly for me. While I am secure and safe for the time being, I'm relying heavily on my parents. If they died suddenly I would be homeless. I don't have my own place. I don't feel secure relying on my parents.

**3. Belongingness and love**
This is your need for intimate relationships, sex, friends, honesty.

This is a huge void for me. I've been single for over 10 years now and I've never had a real serious relationship. I have nobody I feel comfortable talking to. My sexuality is something I keep a secret and I have nobody to talk to about it. I have maybe one friend I feel comfortable around but even with him I can't talk. I am desperate for intimacy. I'm lonely.

**4. Esteem**
This is your need to feel some sense of achievement. Something to be proud of.

I managed to buy my own car recently and I'm doing a job I'm proud of. I wouldn't say I have high self esteem but I think this category isn't something that needs too much focus for me. The last two are much more important.

**5. Self actualisation**
This one I don't understand too much. I think it's in regards to you becoming the truest version of yourself once you've taken care of everything else. Or maybe this is the *result* of taking care of everything else.

But here's my point: maybe it's silly for me to expect myself to be anything but depressed. It makes sense right? I'm living in a place I don't want to live, I'm living with people I don't feel comfortable talking to, I have no one I can confide in, I'm relying on others to keep me from being homeless, I'm living a lie in regards to my sexuality and I have no deep friendships or intimate relationships. Chemical imbalance or not, why WOULDN'T I be depressed? It makes sense. The way I feel matches my situation.

Maybe it isn't about taking pills to be happy about these shitty circumstances. Maybe it isn't about taking my own life because I've fucked it up. Maybe it's possible to change how I feel by working hard to improve my life.

ALL OF THESE SYMPTOMS happened before I got pregnant a second time, and have been intensified since becoming pregnant...

—I'm constantly moody. My emotions change with the drop of a hat.
—I'm constantly wondering why my husband stays with me (he is a GREAT GREAT supporting, caring lover) and am always thinking he deserves better
—I hate waking up on the weekends because I feel like I have no purpose (my almost-three year old is pretty easy to manage despite being rambunctious)
—I am too self conscious to even get out and do something if I know the place I want to go to will be crowded
—I have NO motivation to do anything. Walking to get some fresh air? Nope. Getting out of the house just for a moment to change scenery? Not a chance.
—Everything that I try to do I have NO attention span to continue.

"What is the point? Right know I am quite drunk. So maybe this is the reason I am making he post, Let's be real even though nobody will care, because in order to get people attention you need to write something worth while to respond to or something in that regard.
If I may be honest I  am at the edge of the cliff when it comes to killing myself. I didn't confess to my best friend about my feelings about life, but he somehow deduced from my speech that I may be depressed and said to me to not kill myself. Apparently if I kill myself something in his hearth will be lost. There will be hole inside him if I kill myself. You know what is the worst thing I didn't felt anything when he said that to me. 
Although I can try all sort of things in order to get out of depression, at the end it becomes only worse. Right now the only thing that keeping me from killing myself s mine laziness. I decided the way I end y life is by hanging myself, but I don't have any kind of a rope in me room. I honestly have a no hope in life. I don't want anything. the only thing I can think of is being dead. It's not like I want to kill myself, but being death feels much better(easier or whatever in that sense), than being alive. It's very hard to see good in future when  95 % of your year is feeling like biggest piece of shit. Day, week, month.... I don't know how much I have left, but one thing is sure I am determined to end my life. If I made grammar mistakes, please tell me. It will make me feel better , so I can improve myself.

"Not having a purpose I was diagnosed with depression about 12 years ago, had my ups and downs but I was managing ok. In the last year tho I became ill and I'm currently waiting to get surgery, it's a bit of an unusual surgery and there is only two surgeons in the country that can do it and there is no option to go private so I'm still waiting for a surgery date. 
I kept my job up as long as I could but I am now on sick leave as it was becoming to hard with pain and other complications. Since Iv stoped working tho my depression has just gone right down hill, I'm so reliant on my partner for help and each day is a struggle, Iv lost the structure of working and it's hard to plan anything in advance to look forward to as the surgery could be at any time. 
Iv lost all purpose and feel so lost and like a burden on my loved ones. 

I would try anything to lift this feeling but I'm out of ideas.

"dependency. Depression for me has always been mutual to dependency. Whenever i see the lows of my life it's always when someone is not there for me or they don't treat me like the way they used to before. Then i start having a fucking panic attack trying to figure out what/where i went wrong, then i when i realize that it's just to late and the only pillar that kept me up is now gone and i literally break down. This is when i feel really helpless and depressed, knowing how much i relied on a person and what i am without them.",depression
"Don't know how to start, where to begin, how to move forward if that's even possible Half of me feels like this is a fruitless attempt of shouting into the void, that I'm just wasting time and aggravating my already frustratingly significant pain to no avail.

I don't know how many times I need to keep trying and making zero headway.

I've battled depression for as long as I have memories. I was never happy, and even as the father of two amazing kids I still don't know how to keep going on. I see all these things that I should be doing, and being plagued with chronic pain see all the things I can't do, or shouldn't do because I know the pain it will cause.

And the shitty thing is I wished for this. For so long I wished I could just be off work because it was just too hard, and I couldn't handle it. Which I couldn't. It was just a matter of time before everything fell apart in my working life, so in a way I got out before that happened, but I pay for it every day. And because of the chronic pain, I can't even do things I enjoy without being in agony.

I can't play games. I can't type easily. I can't go for bike rides. I can't easily go for walks. Shit, even sitting down ends up causing me pain, and because my brain is either all or nothing, I'm either sitting for the entire day looking at all the things that need to get done and aren't or I push myself and end up just miserable fighting with that pain.

I'm in my 40s, I think there's a good chance I have BPD, I've been through so goddamn many therapists to no avail, I've had psychiatrists admonish me for my character flaws and for choosing to help alleviate the pain with marijuana. The first psychiatrist I had told me that because I dressed myself and wasn't messy I shouldn't be depressed. That was almost 20 years ago and it still angers me. 

I've tried to see therapists, but going to see a pay-per-session therapist (I'm in Canada, so psychiatry is basically free) ends up just as a tax on my anxiety. I worry that I'm not getting enough out of a session, or I get up in my head about being narcissistic or some stupid shit that I know shouldn't matter.

I've gone from being so selfish that I take take take from everyone to where I'm at a point that I'd rather go without than to ask for help from anyone.

There's two parts of me. One wants help. One wants to get better. I know this is the intelligent side, I know this is the correct side to be on - but I have nothing there to help guide me into that path. How many more doctors do I need to see? How many more attempts to get help do I need to make and fail with? 

My entire adult life I've taken huge jumps to resolve things, but with my pain increasing (the loss of being able to play video games has been really, really, really, REALLY hard for me to get past) I have been trying to desperately try and figure out what I could do, but it's basically watching movies/tv shows - and that poses its own set of issues with my guilt for not doing what needs to be done. 

Shit, I'd love to even participate more in online communities, but typing either on my phone or a keyboard has become agonizing, I know I'm going to suffer from typing this up as it is.

I just don't know what to do. I just don't want to do anything. Drugs? I've tried almost every single option out there. I don't have a doctor who can really supply the help I need and changing doctors in Canada is incredibly stressful (basically you have to pack up and move your entire file over before you can see a new primary care physician, and while my doc isn't perfect, she at least is aware of what's going on and give me the support I don't know I'd get elsewhere).

So what the hell do I do? I just finished Olive Kitteridge and in some ways it reflected so many of the struggles I am fighting with. 

Even typing this out I've had to prevent myself from just dismissing everything and saying forget it - because I know I'm one of countless others who have dealt with this. Like, at the end of all of this, where am I? I'm not going to have some magical experience where someone replies with a perfect solution - it's not possible.

And jesus if I do have BPD... A part of me is scared even more about that. I just wish I could push through, but I feel that's slipping further and further and further away.",depression

"This can't be a good thing. I'm replaceable, I've been replaced several times by friends and lovers. Every time it's caused me untold anger and strife, but this time, if anyone bothers reading up on what I've been going through the past month/3 years, I feel like I'm accepting it. I'm not angry, I'm depressed over it, but I'm feeling like I'm accepting the fact that I'm just going to be in other people's lives momentarily, to better them as a person or help them through a hard time, then immediately be left behind as they go looking for greener pastures.

I don't know.. Every time something like this has happened, I've gone off the deep end with my anger or been depressed to the point of crying randomly or just not wanting to talk to or be around anyone. Now? It's just empty. Like I'm hollowed out and a part of me is okay with, excuse the metaphor, like a lightbulb.

"How to deal with treatment resistant depression I have been dealing with depression for a long time. It's exhausting. Probably about 6 months ago my doctor and I spoke about the fact that it appeared my depression was not responding to my medication and how it appears to be non responsive to treatment.  I didn't want a bump or to do any add ons at the time because I worry about being too medicated and the long term damage.  I'm finding it more difficult to take care of myself, or to even care to do anything.  I'm currently on bupropion 400mg.  I know at this point I need to be upfront with my doc and make some type of change in medicine.  Obviously I'm going to follow whatever my psychiatrist says or prescribes at this point because I need to be able to exist.  I just wanted to see if anyone has had a similar experience and what I should expect or what has worked.  
I know at this point it's not external factors at this point.  I have always been very mindful with taking my medication but I'm just not able to do whatever I'm doing. 
I sometimes beat myself up for not having motivation to do more than just exist. I just can't find anything in myself to do anything. I try to maybe workout or get some sun or just little stuff and I can't bring myself to it. I can't say I do a great job trying anything because I can't bring myself to do anything but whatsoever. In the past I have been able to motivate myself and to take more initiative that to do more than just breath but I can't seem to do more than nothing whatsoever than to wake up and very passively go though my day.

"when you have a long dream about a good life and then wake up still being a worthless piece of shit Just had one of the saddest moments of my life. I just woke up from a REALLY long dream which consisted of like 4 parts and lasted ten hours in reality. sorry for the poorly written long post. I'll start with the story. tl:dr at the bottom

I was laying in my bed drinking whiskey and beer, also playing runescape (which I was doing yesterday actually in reality. lol.). at some point ""dream-me"" gets really drunk so it gets quite hazy. anyway then my mother comes home from her Thailand trip, I somehow manage to act sober and chat with her until she leaves to go to her friend's house. now some weird shit is going to happen, at this point I didnt even realize this because I'm completely hammered.

--I wake up in real life, get a glass of ice cold water, and drift back into my dream.--

I hear voices of some men coming towards me, I open my eyes to realize I'm not in my home - it was like some kind of a jail or something. two men and a younger lady approach me, they said I acted retarded and my neighbors called the ambulance on me because they were worried I'll fall down the stairs. then they showed me on a videotape, I was nude and screaming at top of some stairs, in front of my apartment. I mumbled something like ""d-damn this is h-horrible, sorry about that"" while trying to hold back my laughter. fortunately they let me go, I went outside to smoke a joint, then the day ended as I went home to sleep.

--Wake up again for some water and put food for my cat, then went to sleep. in my dreams I was convinced that these times I woke up for a moment were part of the dream too.--

Wake up to my mother coming visiting again, this time she told me that we're going to visit my grandparents (her parents) in a different city, so we get into a car and start driving. after a few minutes I realized I forgot to lock the door, my mother told that it didnt matter, but I told her to stop and I went out the car. walked back home, although my mother went to her parents house alone now. I drank some beer and fell asleep.

--Wake up to my cat meowing, still convinced it was part of that longass dream, fell asleep pretty quickly again.--

I go to the city now to meet my friends, we hanged out around some kind of a marketplace. I was still tipsy from drinking beer last night. then I randomly meet this wonderful girl (I guess she was a friend of one of my friends) with blonde hair, blue eyes and a very girly-ish high-pitched voice. we start chatting and we talk about life, I told her how I drank myself into jail one night and she laughed and told how cute (lol) that is. at some point she hugs me. feelsgreatman.jpg. we all go to a bus, we were planning to drive a few stops to s different part of the city. now it seems really obvious that the girl is into me. I found out her name was Merilin. we had this crazy idea that we let our friends go off the bus and then we drive to the bus' endstop, she knew a beautiful place in the nature near some caves and huge trees. 

Damn I can still remember even how good her hair smelled and how beautiful she was.

We arrive there, and climb on top of a huge boulder. I was still tipsy from last night so I almost fell down, but she grabbed me with full force, we kinda hugged and kissed then. she tells me how happy she is that she found me. we chat for a long time about our lives and how we met these other friends. I look deeply into her eyes while I lay on the huge rock thinking how beautiful life is, I blink, and when opening my eyes, I'm back in the actual reality, alone next to my bottles of whiskey and shitty beer. I realized everything in the dream was fake, gone.

Don't get me wrong, I am probably the most emotionless person I know, I don't give a shit about love or a good life (anymore), but this was...intense. I recognized the feelings I felt in the dream, I haven't felt any emotion for years, it was really nostalgic feeling. 

I dont give a shit if anyone actually reads this stupid thing, just wanted to write this up, I have these long and weirdly hyper-realistic dreams ~once a year. writing them up and reading later is good because I find some logic about my consciousness and thoughts then, they always mean something importnant. 

TL:DR: Had a long and very realistic dream about an interesting life and how I met a cute girl named Merilin, was staring at her while laying next to her, woke up and realize I'm alone in this shitty life again when I opened my eyes. would kill myself if I didn't love my cat so much. I don't think there needs to be more background than that I have been diagnosed with severe depression and many other mental disorders which are getting worse every year.

end of a shitty story, have a nice day.

"Acceptance Hi, this is my first post to this page. This post is pretty scattered so I apologize right now. 
The last couple weeks have been pretty crazy and I just want to share what's been going on in hopes for some support and in hopes that this might help someone else. 
So back in January I met my previous girlfriend and also decided that I was ready to try to get off medication. It was going to be a good time with good change for my life. I was going to become a new and better person, I thought. I was going to conquer my mental health. I've been diagnosed with a couple of different things but the main ones being OCD and depression. I initially got onto medication with some degree of reluctance but was convinced to try it out by an old therapist. I was on it for 2 years before I decided to stop. I was raised in church and also just have a lot of pride so I've had a lot of stigmatizing beliefs when it comes to mental illness. I never even fully accepted my own diagnoses. I figured I was well educated on OCD and depression and I could meditate and exercise my way out of it. Especially when it came to OCD I thought the knowledge of what was going on would be about enough to handle it. Well the OCD flared up in the relationship and I was not even discussing it all with my therapist at the time because I was embarrassed of the obsessions I was having. I was falling into weird dark depressive states regularly but kept pushing through like I have been all my life. I'm 24 and I remember depressive thoughts and feelings since jr high. My grandma was diagnosed with bipolar 1 and my mother has major depressive disorder. I thought I could outrun it and it'd be different for me. I was going to change the family trend. I was trying to fix my broken brain with my broken brain. I was trying to analyze irrational obsessions and snowballing negative thoughts and talk through them to get better, but it really felt like I was falling into a spiraling trap of trying to rationalize thoughts that were never rational in the first place. I has having constant tension headaches and diarrhea from the anxiety and depression. I felt detached and grew extremely irritable. I fucking hated everyone and myself. i was lost in ruminating about the past over things that didn't used to bother me and over things that I thought I had worked through. I was drowning once again. Everything felt so ugly. For me, life looks ugly when I'm depressed. A sunny summer day looks and feels so ugly and uncomfortable. I ended up breaking up with my girlfriend and I think i felt the freedom to finally feel what was going on. My mind was so fucking loud and spiraling into dark places and I was feeling so beaten. Even though I've lived through this shit before, I've never outwardly acknowledged or truly validated what was going on, that it was real. I learned to white knuckle and push through and had done that for years because I just assumed everybody was doing the same. I didn't want to be the weak one to give up if everyone else was feeling the same thing and they were able to move along just fine. I was bombarded with suicidal thoughts one day on the drive to work. I tried to work for an hour and told my boss I was sick and needed to leave. I was so dead. it was the first time I gave myself rest for the reason that depression was consuming me and I couldn't fight it any more. The next week at work I was crying in the bathroom every day mostly about my ex-girlfriend, then just about the helplessness, the non-stop obsessive negative self-talk and criticism, and weird hopelessness that was finally killing me. I stayed at my parents at the end of the week and had a dream where I saw myself as a little boy. He looked so joyful and innocent and I felt so sorry for him and hate what happened. He didn't get the life he deserved. I was crying non-stop and felt like I was dying. My head was so fucking loud with thoughts that I didn't want and couldn't shake. That night I stopped at the train tracks and truly felt like I was ready to end my life. 50 more years of this sounds like hell. It's fucking unbearable. I fully believed that everyone would move along just fine if i was gone. I believed I did what I could, made a good run of 24 years but this life was not for me. The only thing that stopped me at the time was my parents and siblings. I lasted one more day at work after that and couldn't go back. I filled my family in on how bad things had gotten and had to move back home. I've been finally realizing depression is fucking real and it's not something I chose. I was trying to choose my way out of it, but it didn't work. I give up. I got back on medication and after 1 week I can already feel a difference. It's just so weird to me accepting this. It's so real and I can't turn it off. My mind is busted and mental illness is real. Now I'm in outpatient and just trying to get better before I start my new job. I just feel kind of speechless at this realization. I've always told myself it isn't real, you're making it up, it's all in your head. But it's taking over and I can't do it on my own. I'm just working to accept the reality of what's going on. Thanks to whomever read this. I just need to hear that this is real",depression

It was okay for her to have problems, cut herself, have panic attacks, be miserable because of depression and cry randomly when she thought I'd leave her for no reason.Get angry at me for not always agreeing to her ideas or have work and fall out with me.  But I accepted all that. I loved her for it. I loved that she felt she could open up like that to me. 

But as soon as my issues I told her about on our very first date became an actual problem it was too much.  She left as soon as I Accepted I wasn't mentally okay.  I feel punished for it. 

Obviously to all you readers the facts are not all apparent, I loved this girl with all my heart. She betrayed my trust on New Years and hurt me ""triggering"", for lack of a better word,  the trust issues and insecurity I had. While I don't know and will never know if she intended to cheat I know I found enough evidence to confront her on that possibility.

 I didn't always treat her right after that and I will own that as long as memories permit me to. I was verbally cruel when I was drunk sometimes, I was cold and distant other times. Once I realised though that this was unhealthy for myself and her it was too late. I got counseling, I visited doctors. This is the hard part. 

She was proud of me, she was proud of me for attempting to regain control and trust her. She said everything would be okay for us and we'd make it again she made me feel the safety I had grown accustomed to around her. Then she broke my fucking heart and left anyway. She didn't give me that chance, a week after I began getting help and she said those things she left because she just wasn't happy in our relationship anymore.Even though I made her happy? what the fuck?

Why was it okay for over a year for her to be damaged? but as soon as I accepted it was okay for me to be damaged too it was over. I'm far more broken now than I was. I feel so alone.

Tl;Dr: Girlfriend left after I finally accepted I have problems and sought help, was probably too late.. ",depression
"Feeling empty for these last few years (7-8) i've had this constant empty feeling  


i had a girlfriend i was extremely happy for because she saw right through my bullshit and self harm, but because i was a dumbass and was in a difficult state of mental health back then i kept pushing her away. She kept trying to reel me back in, this went on for a few months until she couldn't take it anymore, i completely understand her, and we broke off.  


been addicted to self harm since then, i have gotten alot better but i have relapses now and then. The feeling i get when i Harm i can't describe properly, but basically everything freezes for the moment and i feel alive and in control.

​

For the last 3 years i have been chasing the feeling i had with my ex but i can't find anyone seeming even remotely interested in me, im not the full package in no way, im intelligent, bring good conversation and honestly ready to devote all the time i got to whoever seems just a little bit interested, but im chubby, too tall and the worst of all, Terrified of women.  


my friends and family try to set me up with all kind of girls but none of them cared about me in the slightest. Basically i get friendzoned the second girls look at me  


i know i'm getting closer and closer to suicide everyday, been in this dark pit for the last 2 months, im just too much of a pussy to go through with it

"It's been getting worse. And this time I can't stop it. Hey everyone,

so, this is a little weird, but I don't really have anyplace else to go or talk. It's been hard. I have been dealing with all sorts of bullshit, sickness, death, abuse, selfharm and suicidal thoughts all my life but lately I have been fading.
I have been distancing myself without wanting to, kept from work because the only thing I wanted to do was throw myself infront of the next car and basically stayed home...alone...scared of myself. 
I cut. I bleed. I go to sleep. That's so far always worked for me. Always regretted it in the morning, but who doesn't. I deserve it. 
But lately sleep has been making things worse. Not that I can barely get my eyes to shut, but I feel like sleep is making me relive things, remember things I wanted to forget so badly. 
I have started to doubt myself beyond any point in my life so far, basically smashing selfhate at myself. And having no defense, no one to talk to, no one to vent to, no one to listen. Or breathe with me when I can't.
I got out of the hospital last week for almost actually dying. (This time it was my bodies fault though.) And I am scared to go back. I am scared to fail and disappoint people who put faith in me. I am not confident and I don't have the strength to put on that mask anymore. I feel like I have finally reached my end. It's not that I think about suicide all the time, it's just constantly in my head, if I want it or not. 
I tried to get better and I did. For a while. 

So why is this coming back now?
Why am I being tortured by myself again for the smallest things? 
I don't want to be like this anymore, I want to be free. I feel like I am being held underwater by my own hands but I have no control left.

I think I may actually give up tonight. And I am not sure I will come out of this...",depression

I feel like if I hadn't went through a specific trauma I would've been able to connect and find common grounds with people. I'm so disconnected from everyone. What even bothers me the most is the fact I'm a minority within a minority,  it's isolating when you can't find someone going through the same shit you're going through.  

I honestly gave up on the whole connection thing a long time ago, but whenever I feel confident to try it out I just think "" well,maybe it wouldn't turn out like the other ones"" and then I'm wrong again.  It's like the universe is trying to tell me that you should just give up, cause this is not for you boo. You shouldn't trust anyone, you're not meant to enjoy life like the rest, everybody hates you, this is your position in life. Is to be hated by everyone and pushed aside.

"Social anxiety I have really bad social anxiety to the point my parents have said they thought I might've been diagnosed with Aspergers when I was younger because of my behavior problems but because I was never properly diagnosed with anything until now it's still a mystery. 

When I was a young kid I never played with anyone and if I wanted to I'd walk up to their parents to ask if I could play. I was really reserved, rarely had tantrums and I was always on my own. Throughout elementary I was the same way besides being bullied severely, every day. Not to mention both sides of my family were awful so I became shy/quiet around them too. 
Few dramatic things that made me even more weird. 

When it came to middle school I was bullied badly again, much worse until I moved schools and had to break from my protection. 
I ended up with two friends I have still today but making friends was always the hardest thing. 
Although, I swear I was born to be social but I'm positive the bullying and family traumas made me so socially retarded. 

The thing is when I talk to someone new or even like my friends family who I've known for five years? Something like that, I freeze up. I freeze up, I stutter awfully, I try way too hard to act relaxed. I'm a completely different person unless we're sitting down and it's one on one. That's the only reason I'm okay with my friends because it's one on one.
It also takes me a really long time to get comfortable with anyone, it seriously takes me years. My friends family is practically my own, almost five years of going over there every day and I still can't function when they talk to me. 

I really hate it, I hate how bad I am with talking. You'd swear I'm ether the fakest or a mute or I hate everyone but I just can't talk. 
I have anxiety meds and they still don't 'cure' this. ",depression

"Cannot get anything done I'm in a bad bout of depression.  It doesn't help that I'm far from home with no support system and in a demanding job.

"How does Panic Attack and physical symptoms can be related Hydration?????   

You are sitting on the couch causally watching your favorite TV show and all of sudden you start feeling like your heart is racing and pounding for no reason. Next thing you find out is that you start feeling numbness and tingling in your hands or legs. Also, you might feel like you can't breathe easily and you think you need to open the window to get some fresh air. Some of you might feel like anytime you go to bed to sleep your legs are going numb and feel heavy for no obvious reason. You might wake up middle of the night and feel like your hand is as heavy as 20 pounds while you are soaked in your own sweat. You will realize that you don't have much appetite left and you can't even eat. You might even go to the bathroom more often like you are having diarrhea with severe stomach ache.  Some of you will also have headaches pretty much every day and feel dizzy. 

**What does all these signs and symptoms have to do with hydration?** 

Our body has the most fascinating mechanism that I've encountered in my entire life and that's why I chose medicine. 

Our body responds differently anytime we are under stress or when we have panic attacks.

1-When you are having panic attacks your heart rate goes up and with that the energy expenditure increases as well; hence, our body uses more blood to supple the energy and guess what's 55% of our blood? Yes, WATER. 

2-We are also breathing faster to get more air in which we are ""breathing off water"". 

3-Now, when we are stressed out, our body produces cortisol and other hormones which they are going to increase our heart rate and also produce more sugar in our body which eventually are going to consume more WATER. 

4- You are sweating probably every night and guess what are you losing? Yes, WATER.

5- When our body is under stress it tends to bring the blood from your extremities to the core (heart and large muscles to support the fight and flight mode). 

6- Now, we don't have enough blood circulating to our extremities and guess what happens when you don't have enough blood supply to your extremities? It causes numbness and tingling which is the same as sleeping over your hand and cuting the blood flow. 

7- Also you will have decreased blood flow to your brain which can result in headaches and dizziness since there is not much blood going into your brain. 

8- Least but not least you will realize that you are drinking enough water why? Well who cares about drinking water when you are stressed out, right? 

So not only we are losing 3-4 times more water that usual but also we are not even drinking as much as we used to which makes it double negative for our water reservoir. 

**How can you tell if you are dehydrated?** 

The easiest way is to check your urine when you are going to the bathroom. If you are dehydrated it color is darker and more yellow

Also, you feel find your skin is not moist or warm anymore. 

**How to fix it?** 

Simply just drink WATER…. Keep drinking water like a glass of water every hour or so. 

It might take a couple of days for your body to get hydrated and in order for those symptoms to subside it might take days to weeks. 

I hope this was helpful guys, I've suffered for months without knowing that it was the main cause for those horrific symptoms. I had to self-diagnose myself but I'm glad I figured it out and I hope I can help those who are suffering from it too. ",depression

"There is nothing for me I used to believe in all sorts of things. I thought that i had something special about me, that i had a soul, that i had a reason to live and that live altogether has some meaning. I also thought there was some kinda great future for me. But now that all is gone. 

Basically i'm just a hunk of meat and bones in an world without any meaning. I am nothing. What i do, doesn't matter. Most people don't give a sh*t about me. If i would vanish, it would probably take weeks before anybody would start to wonder what has happened to me. And probably for mostly selfish reasons; they just wanted something from me. They don't really care. And nobody wants to be with me and i understand why; i don't have any status, i'm not popular, i'm not strong, i am introverted and shy. And i am also heavily addicted to porn (watch it about 3 hours every day). That has basically destroyed me sexually. I am unable to have any romantic relationships.

And future for me is sh*t. Just some meaningless, stupid and low-income job in some faceless corporation. My education and (former) dreams don't matter at all, because nobody pays from them. The only thing in this world what seems to matter is money and profit. If you can't make them, then f*ck you.

And the most pathetic thing is that i am already 26. Most of my so-called friends have partners (some are even married), decent jobs and useful educations. Some are also succesful artists in the area where i live. 

So i don't really want to live anymore. But I know that i can't even commit suicide because i am afraid it would just make me crippled and permanently injured. F*ck this all, i'm just going to get drunk and watch porn. Like i always do. ",depression

She'll have cancer for her entire life. But due to her positivity and my father's nonchalant attitude about it, it doesn't affect me nearly as much as it did.

We have our good moments at times, good laughs, even mediocre sex that I can live with, no matter how horny I get (he's my first and only :') ). But I did it for money.

It's manageable, and I work and do my part too, but it still sucks.

But I'm left wondering the ""what if.""
I'm not in UCLA right now. I couldn't. The costs of housing were too crippling -- Brentwood is expensive as hell, and so is student housing and commuting. So I'm going to a different university, one much less prestigious.
But I find myself constantly daydreaming about living at UCLA, living the typical college experience that I feel was my god given right because I worked my ass off in school. I imagine myself with time to study and do group projects. I imagine myself sleeping with people, maybe exploring more of my bisexuality since I've never had the chance to and now I'm never going to. Maybe making friends.
I've been trying to make peace with these things, and many others, but I'm failing.

I just can't seem to get a grip of my emotions. I have outbursts of anger and sadness. It drags everyone around me down. I see my feelings as a cancer. That tears apart everyone in it's way. I just feel like a poison to everyone slowly running them down before they get rid of me. I only want the people I love to be happy. And I feel like the only way for them to be happy is if I'm gone. Not even dead but I was planning on running away so everyone could assume I went missing and not blame me or think I'm selfish. The reason suicide is being brought into this is because I don't know if I could live without my loved ones. So I'd run away and kill myself because I need them and without them there's no point. 
This was brought on because I just exploded at the person who loves me unconditionally. I didn't mean to I just feel angry and I don't know why I took it out on them. It was really silly. But I've hurt them, like I always do. It's not fair on them. No one should be afraid of their partner, or worry about when their next outburst will be. Right now would be perfecting timing to run away as this area is in the country, mostly forest, very few houses, and I'd actually get lost so I wouldn't be able to backtrack on myself and hurt everyone all over again.

I really don't want to sound snobbish in any way and I get that this already is a great privilege, but I also can't help how I feel about this.

Another thing which always really bugs me is just the feeling of loneliness. I really always tried to be nice to everyone, but still I've always struggled with finding a partner. I should also mention that I've been largely bald from my eighteenth, I think this played a factor as well. But just the fact that I've been both trying really hard to find someone and at other times not trying too hard, just makes me think that I'm just meant to be alone. And I know it sounds silly and cliche and a lot of people will tell me ""no eventually you'll find someone"" or other cliche things. But I simply don't believe this is true, it even really starts bugging me when someone says this. Is it so weird for someone to just be alone for his entire life? What if people just never are attracted to you? It can't be that uncommon. You might have bad genes and not reproduce, that just simple natural selection, to put it in a more dry way. 

Anyway. So to get through each day, I usually do things that take up my full concentration, like playing video games, they keep me from my own negative thoughts. Although, sometimes I feel so bad, I can't even enjoy happy moments anymore because they become overshadowed by the negative thoughts I have. I try to revitalize my will to live by keeping busy with things that I'm fascinated by, which is mostly new technology. I learn about AI or VR and things related to that. But slowly I'm starting to lose my passion for that too. Realistically, I won't make any major contribution to society with those things. And I also don't have someone to share my passions with. If anything, I usually only feel like a tool to other people. People will contact me, a lot actually, but only when they need something from me. I feel like a robot to them. It's as if I'm meant to just work and get money in return. 

All this being said, I have a few very close friends, and I do tell them how I feel, but I don't think they can actually help me. They will listen, and it is a relief to be able to tell them how I feel. But I also feel like I'm a nuisance to them and I know that there can only be real change if I do something myself. I just don't know what to do. And then there's this great sense of nihilism that tells me that nothing really matters and I might as well just take my life. I'm just a sad story, a failure of nature if you will, not really meant to live in the current society.

So yeah. If anyone has some advice or can give me new insights, I'd really appreciate that. Even more so, if you have more than advice and you'd genuinely be interested into turning my life around from the sad story it is now, I'd be happy to meet you. Because I also believe I have way more to offer to the world than just the robot person I am today. Maybe I just met all the wrong people. Or maybe I didn't and I just have a psychological problem. I honestly don't know anymore. ",depression
"Is it normal/healthy to feel that you need someone to be happy? To preface, I know ""normal"" is a completely subjective concept, but I just want to know if how I am feeling and acting is detrimental to my wellbeing. 

I suffer from clinical depression that's most likely genetic, though I've had my fair share of traumatic events that could easily have led to it. To make this short and concise, I've mostly gotten a handle on it, though it's a constant struggle and I always strive to change whatever I can in the hope of eventually getting off antidepressants. 

My question stems from what makes me genuinely happy in life and the conflicting answers I've been told by people that are close to me. I mostly feel flat or neutral with minor ups and downs because of my antidepressants, but I've found that I feel truly and wholly happy with my significant other. I'm unsure if I should shun this feeling, as I've felt this way before and got brought down to one of the lowest points in my life when it ended, and should therefore become totally reliant on myself for finding a source of happiness, or welcome it and invest myself wholly in this person. 

Thank you for any help that anyone might offer. ",depression

So I'm feeling a fairly down at the moment but talking to people only makes things worse. Also I'm not motivated at all for anything and spend the majority of the evenings/weekend in bed. I just don't care and am so lazy, and I hate myself for it. I'm not diagnosed but please help.

"I finally decided to get help but it seems my depression isn't severe enough I finally decided to get help but it seems my depression isn't severe enough. My uni offers free psychiatrist appointments and now I must wait about a month and a half to get an appointment. However, I'm not quite sure if I can make it that long.

I have been depressed as long as I remember. My mother is an alcoholic and my father has a great deal of anger issues. My childhood was a mix of screaming and drinking. Though our family looked quite normal outside, my parents are academic and I would say we are upper middle class. My grades were always straight A's even though I have severe dyslexia (so forgive me some mistakes). I excelled in sports and always made sure that everything looked great outside. I dreaded that people would find out that everything wasn't as it looked. 

A while ago my mother described my childhood as ""happy"" and I really wonderwd why. Yes, for sure we were well of and traveled a lot and I was able to have as many hobbies as I wanted. However, what I remember most from my childhood is my mom drinking until she would pass out and my father would get angry and start screaming. My mother would forget everything as she does when she passes out. The main problem with her lack of memory was that I wasn't sure if she would remember promises that she had made. I wasn't sure if she would get me from school or dance practices or would remember buy me tampons etc. She was always so untrustworthy and I had to constantly remind her about promises that she made.  

My parents never praised me or showed any interested in my education. They never helped me with my homework or asked me what I want to do when I grow up. My mother never told me about periods or makeup etc. I got used to being alone and taking care of myself and because of my childhood I never feel loneliness but also, I don't need other people. I'm not interested in social media or what my friends do. It's difficult for me open up and I'm not quite sure how to rely on other people. My lack of interest in everything troubles me and I'm not able to define a purpose to continue living. I don't feel sad (I never cry) but also I'm don't feel angry towards my parents. I just feel nothing. Overall this feeling of nothingness is the only constant thing in my life and I wonder how I even live without it.

"I have absolutely zero ambition to do the important stuff. I don't know if anyone can relate, cause I'm very weird but I've grown very tired of playing by the rules of the game of life.

 I've tried college for example: dropped out because it wasn't for me and I felt humiliated. I wasn't very motivated in the first place tbh. Then I succeeded in an evening classes-course and I thought it was fun and interesting and all, but not for doing it as a job, just as more of like a hobby.(I'm talking about psychology.) Now that I ""proved"" myself to me and know that I can succeed in something, I see zero point in attempting college or anything like that ever again, cause it made me miserable. I'm tired of trying my best for jobs I don't even want to do and coming across assholes who call themselves professors.

 I took driving classes, because my parents wanted me to, not because I had any drive to drive(ha) whatsoever. Other people my age always seemed way more excited about the prospect of driving than me. I never got that. To me, it just seemed boring and pointless to cram for a theoretical exam about boring road rules, just to be able to sit next to some random stranger who would tell you what to do in practice. More than half of the people who are out on the road don't even respect the rules of traffic anyway. 

Anyways, the combination of having zero interest in the whole thing, my driving instructor being a real dick and me being a spoiled millennial who could always count on people to drive me around, made for an embarrassing cocktail of failure and me being left with a semi-trauma. I have never attempted to learn how to drive again. I don't feel the urge to do it. 

I know I should get a job, drive and all that shit to survive, but I don't have any motivation. It's just all kind of blah to me. I feel like I've already tried enough and it never works out. I'm tired of it all. I don't want to be a slave to the system, I know I sound like an edgy teenager, but to me work equals prison. All the people around me constantly complain about their job, how it robs them of all their free time etc...

When people around me tell me what to do, it just pisses me off and makes me want to do those things even less. People can be super-judgemental if you don't fit their definition of normal. I can't share my sentiment of complete nihilism and purposelessness with anyone, cause no one seems to get it. They just think I'm lazy. ",depression

"Downhill extremely fast A few weeks ago i smoked some weed. I believe it did something to trigger a depressive illness. Ive been on lamotrigine for bipolar for the last year almost and it pretty much contained my depression prior to the weed and it was relatively non existent even before.

The same night i smoked i tried to kill myself by overdoing on benzos and alcohol. I ended up in the hospital. Ever since its been a constant downhill battle, i live halfway across the country from my family so my dad decided to fly me home to see if itd help for a week. Im leaving my family today and going back to where i live. My sister lives in my town but shes planning on moving so i will pretty much be out of family except my nephew.

Im losing my mind in the airport because i know exactly what im heading back to. I can't talk to anyone about it because i dont want to stress anyone out or have them worry about me, i cant do that to them.

If i was struggling around my family and im still going downhill, how am i supposed to deal when im not really around anyone. Ive just been getting worse. Friends dont really seem to care or maybe they just dont know what to say.

"I live in the UK, how would I get a diagnosis without my family knowing? I'm 18, I live in the UK and I'm pretty sure I have depression, but I don't want to self-diagnose and I don't want to say ""I have depression"" unless I've been diagnosed. Obviously, I need to go to a doctor about it. But the problem with that is I still live with my abusive mum, who I REALLY don't want finding out about how I'm feeling, because she WILL use it against me. 

Our normal GP (where I'm registered) is deliberately miles away so that my mum has to drive me there and find out why I need to go to the doctor. Every time I've been so far, she has also insisted on coming into the appointment with me. I can't drive myself yet and I don't really know the way.

There are other GPs within walking distance. I know that I *should* be able to talk to doctors without her knowing because I'm 18, but how can I do so without changing my GP registration? And is it possible (if I need them further down the line) to get medication without her knowing?

"I am at my wit's end About a year ago, I finally decided to get help. I had been depressed for the better part of a year at that point, but for the longest time I just kept telling myself that everyone goes through rough patches and once I reached this or that milestone (exams, holidays, etc) I would have some time to myself and things would be better. Things never did get better though. 


So I made the leap, saw my doctor and got a prescription for Cipralex, went on sick leave from my studies, and finally told my friends and family what was up with me. Initially it felt like a huge burden had been lifted off my shoulders, and everyone seemed very understanding and supportive. Unfortunately that didn't last. 



A couple of months went past without any noticable changes, and those close to me seemed to be getting frustrated with my lack of progress. This lead to a lot of fights, which didn't particularly improve my mood. In the end, I had just had enough and started telling them what they want to hear: That I am doing just fine. It gives me some respite, but I do feel guilty about lying to them and as fucked up as it is, I do feel guilty about my mental health not improving at a rate that would give them some peace of mind. 


Anyway, here we are a year later and I don't feel any better. I've made several false starts at continuing work on my thesis, but it just seems completely hopeless. I felt that the medicine helped me in the beginning, but I don't really feel like I am getting any effect from it anymore. Part of me feels like it's time to check in at the funny farm, but I already feel like enough of a burden to those close to me and I don't want to trouble them any further.  ",depression
"Every time I think I have gotten over my depression it just comes back and it sucks so much There is so many times where I go through a few months of being depressed, really just wanting to sleep all day and just feel sorry for myself then something mildly good will happen, my mindset will change and I will feel good for a few week.

Today I had a pretty bad relapse. I didn't do anything but I feel so tired and I want to go lay in bed.

"Being stuck in a paradox Hi everyone, hope you're doing well, because I'm not. 

Lately, I've been feeling severely depressed due to a couple of different things, and I've made the realization that it's impossible for me to break out of the negative spiral. So, let me start off by letting you know that I'm a 17 year old male currently in my junior year in high school. I have about 5 or 6 guy friends that i hang out with at school, and sometimes during the weekend. However, I don't feel satisfied with my social life since i often spend my weekends at home, completely alone while they are out partying etc. The problem isn't that i don't get invited, but rather that I can't go there because i suffer from a chronic eye disease leaving me with a weakened immune system, which means that I always get sick after being at a party and having a couple of drinks. This means that i won't be able to do workout the following week, which makes me feel terrible. Neither can I go out the next weekend, which means that the people i connected with at the previous party, especially women, will think that I'm just a loser being at home every weekend.

The thing is, I need to be at a party in order to interact with people i don't normally hang out with, since I'm introverted. This leaves me feeling unsatisfied and depressed when I'm spending the weekend at home. I also feel super depressed the day after a party since I know that I will never meet this girl again, because I can't party every weekend like she will. I sit at home knowing that she's at a party talking, laughing, and just having a good time with some other guy. 

So, how the fuck do I have a social life and meet girls if the only time I can do that is at parties, and I can't go partying every weekend since i will get sick? This has been going on for almost a year, and it has just gotten worse. I'm stuck in a dark tunnel and I'm beginning to wonder if i will ever see the light again.",depression
"The fact that my ex fiance leaved me for someone else makes me realize that i'm suffer from anxiety I never thought about it this way, but this really bad experience is making me realize that i'm suffer from anxiety. I'm afraid that the anxiety turns into something worse. I'm someone that always think loud, i walk in my apartment from place to place talking to myself. 3 days ago, when i oficially discovered that she leaved me for another guy, i woke up at 4 am and i was basically drowning myself because of the pain and what happened. I was breathing so fast and then i started crying so much that i felt shame of myself. I was feeling sorry for my own self. I have never been suicidal. Actually right now i'm facing the most difficults and painfuls days in my 26 years of life. Not only because what she did, but also because i live in a country that is full of misery and pain. I don't have too much friends, i don't go out and share with anyone. The few people that i care are my mom, my nephew and 2 friends that don't live in my city. and are not always there.  

​

But even with this experience, even when now i'v been betrayed by the person that i loved and care the most, someone that i thought it was an angel. Someone that i thought that will never lied or do something like this. Someone that i really loved, someone that was my inspiration and my main goal in life. Someone that i really trusted for the first time in my life. Even now when i live in this country,  full of misery, sadness, hopeless and pain. With almost no true friends. Without going out, not even for a coffe with a friend. With almost no money. Even with all of that, i'm still fighting to make my dreams a reality. I still have a possitve mind, to be better. To get better. To learn. To grow up. To love myself. To still be the person that i am and make it better.

And something that anyone will not ever take from me, the feeling of doing the right thing. The feeling of being a good person. And also, i do believe in karma. So this girl will have what she deserve. And i won't be there for her. And that's a shame, but she did it to herself.

I have considered running away and dying without anyone ever seeing it. I have considered many thoughts like this, even hurt myself, but I'm simply a coward. The few close friends I have are tired of me, and I have lost many people over the years because of my issues. I speak to my therapist, but bringing up the suicidal thoughts seems so shameful, and hospitalization is not something I want....

I have tried to become different so many times, but my past catches up to me. I feel paralyzed and exhausted. I just wish I could be someone different entirely, with a different past...",depression
"Question for those on meds. I'm on my third or fourth different medication for depression and this one like the others was good for about 6 weeks and I'm starting to lose hope that there is a medication that is going to help me.

"Please read this i seek advice or help I really don't know how to start this or how long do I write to share the thoughts i have.
It is about:  1- vengeful thoughts. 2-low self-esteem. 3-confrontation fear.

First of all , I am 25 years old male.
When I was young , I used to get screams and shouts from my uncles , (by the way, my father is weak-minded , I don't know how to put it , he doesn't make decisions uncles do, low eye sight, weak personality and mental problems  too) but this is irrelevant now just wanted to mention it.
I keep getteing shouts for simple matters, was hit by mom when i was young , stabbed in the leg when i was young (10 years old) by my mom for simple matters (sticking too much time in my neighbors house and the woman neighbor told my mom) oh god why do i have to remember this.
Anyway i love my mom so much now she is very nice to me since i started going to college. She's somehow weak minded too but not as my father she just doesn't make decisions, my elder sisters do.

So i got shouted when i was young. Also, my elder sister when i was in juniour high school and high school times used to look in disgusted way towards me because i am pretty tall and she kept saying ""you are so tall you look embarrassing why are you like this"" i get very emotional and embarrassed in these moments and I didnt like it one bit and it was very ling time when i get these looks and embarrassments from old sister and some cousing , even some of them said ""lower your head to be shorter"" . 

Anyway, don't want to bother you readers about the past all the time, but my childhood past was always about matters like that ONLY. I didn't enjoy my childhood.

I have a low-self esteem and I don't know if it has to do with that past. I used to BENT my head from time to time. I don't usually make very long conversations i get embarrassed sometimes or i get a rush feeling like ""i talked enough and i am happy they seem they like the way i talk"" and then get nervous and shakey and want this to end so I don't want to let them down if i stuttered or talk irrelevantly later on. I get many feelings trying to look good and not embarrassing my self.  I don't like the way it is really. ( LOW SELF-ESTEEM)

 The second thing, when someone says a bad joke about me i get used to pass it. 
Also , when someone shouts at my face , i get really scared inside, I don't what to say anything, i just say "" ok no problem or sorry or try to escape from this "" 
(I used to get scared when my uncles shouted on me on and on) even now when they come at our house i get nervous or scared of a habit. 
I DON'T CONFRONT PEOPLE. When someobe screams , shout , i get really scared don't know how to talk or look in the eye. I also afraid to get hit. (CONFRONTATION FEAR)

The last but not least , when i get to bed , i used to think of my self when i was young, "" i get shouted and then i shout back and tell them to stop"" "" i get hit , i hit back and win"" ""i get shout from uncle and i shout back or let them get afraid of me"" "" I MAKE MY SELF IN A SCENARIO WHERE I GET SHOUTED OR HIT AND THEN I FIGHT TO WIN"" i do this every time in bed.
In Contrary , before i sleep , i used to make a scenario where i make my uncle or some stranger have pity on me when they scream and then they appologise with tears."" But i have stopped some how on thinking like that when i sleep i just get vengeful thoughts( VENGFUL THOUGHTS)  ""i really like it because i see my self had some fight back with winning. ""

I don't know if i named them well but those are the things: 
1. Low-Self Esteem ( i hate)
2. Confrontation Fear ( i hate) 
3. Vengful thoughts ( i some how like and I don't know if it is ok)

I am very very sorry to make it that long I just wanted to share. 

Please if there is any ADVISE I can take, I will be more than happy. 

Thank you very much for readings this really!!",depression
"Today I realised how bad my depression really is. I'm in a hospital right now contemplating why I decided to overdose and commit suicide. Yesterday my girlfriend, the one I thought of the world, broke up with me. I tried fighting for us but it made no difference to her. I finally lost the hope of being happy.

"New to Wellbutrin My wife was prescribed Wellbutrin today after being on Effexor the last couple years. Effexor left her feeling flat, nearly numb. No lows, but definitely no highs either.

Has anyone else done this?

A few months ago i lost all intrest in everything i was full  of self hate anger and fustration that i couldnt get rid off. Everyone around me could express their feelings and worries/problems, i would continuously try and help and make my frienss feel better about their problems, while i just kept it in and pretended nothing was wrong and that everything was completely fine, as i didnt want to seem like i was begging for attention and i didnt want to be a nuisance

"alone in a crowded room yesterday, i was in the middle of a party- we were all on the dancefloor, and i was right on the edge, when i just felt myself become so detached from the scene. i could've been a ghost. i felt as if i was a million miles away from the scene: the noise was empty and hollow, and all i could think of was that if i walked away right then, despite being next to my friends, no one would notice. no one would care, no one would account for me.

i've been feeling like this since i was 13, all through high school. it would come out of nowhere, the sadness, the aching emptiness. that i was worthless. that i would die alone, with everything unfinished. i can see the future i want, but there's just a huge gap between here and there, and i can't even see a bridge across, just darkness.

i get upset over the smallest things. at my grad, after the ceremony, everyone was taking pictures with their friend groups, everyone was having fun, and i was alone in the middle of it all: friend to all, but friend to none. i never felt so alone, in the middle of that crowded room. i felt like i was worthless. like despite knowing these people for years, i didn't truly know them, and they didn't truly know me.

sometimes, i wake up with this ache in my chest, this gaping hole of unbearable emotional pain. i cry it out, but after a while, the apathy appears, smothers everything. 

i don't want to be apathetic anymore. i don't want to hurt anymore. it's like as if i can muster emotions for 0.5 seconds doing something (like watching videos), and after i just shut down. i don't want to feel this way anymore. i could work myself to tears thinking about how worthless i am, but after that, the apathy eats it all up: it wouldn't matter to me anymore. 

i don't want to feel this way forever.",depression

"Fighting Apathy I feel that expressing my mind to friends, family, counselors and therapists has never brought me the satisfaction or closure that I think I need, so I'm trying something new by writing about what's recently been keeping my mind busy in a clear, concise manner to the Internet. I believe that I've been experiencing varying degrees of apathy over the course of 6 years now.  

I'm going to start with a rundown of some recent major events from my life.  

A few months ago, my second long-term girlfriend (let's call her *S*) dumped me. I don't date often because I've always figured that I should work on loving myself before I can allow myself to love others. Though if a relationship falls into my lap, I won't turn it down - good things generally come to me when I stop looking for them and I try to remember that the world owes me nothing. Getting back on track, let me summarize the reason *S* broke up with me. When we first started dating, she claims that she had never really liked herself, but over the course of our time together, she found that I inadvertently taught her to love herself for the first time in her life. The caveat to this however, was that she felt like she only had place to love one person in her life at a time, meaning that yours truly was out of the game. I didn't say a word during the break-up and stayed relatively stoic while she cried. Once it was over, I told her that I was happy for her and that I had my suspicions of how she was feeling from the beginning of our relationship to the end. I then got up from the bench we were sitting on and left to go take a bus home feeling somewhat sad, proud, alone, happy and empty.  

A week later, my best friend (let's call her *P*) lost her battle with cancer. I, her friends and her husband all knew that her two-year timeframe was nearing its end around this time, so it wasn't at all unexpected. I won't ever forget where I was and what I was doing when I got the call to come back to my hometown when *P* passed, but I'll remember even more so the importance and inspiration *P* had and brought in my life. We met when she extended her friendship at a summer job where I knew absolutely no one. Since then, we were inseparable. To make a long story short, she and I went through thick and thin together, knowing that we could rely on and confide into each other at any time.  

If you've read up till here, I appreciate that you've kept up with me this far.  

I've suffered from diagnosed depression for about 5 years now with the end sometimes feeling so close and at other times nonexistent. I'd be lying if I told you that I never felt anger in the aftermath of these events. *P* had so much to give in life (more than I do, certainly) and was just on the brink of beginning a new chapter of her life with her recently-wed husband. I've felt like I ended up used by *S* in her human quest for self-acceptance, but I try to focus on the beautiful fact that I was able to heal someone on this magnitude despite the fact that I didn't get the same opportunity. I miss them both terribly. 
 

Circumstances in our lives cause *S* and me to cross paths very often in social settings, making it extremely difficult to properly move on without resorting to feelings of bitterness and resentment on both our parts despite us mutually expressing interest in remaining friends at multiple moments. I wish I had *P* here to talk to about this, but I don't. *P* and *S* were the only people in my life that I could spend time with indefinitely without needing a break, so I don't feel properly relieved when confiding in anyone else despite how much we might care for each other.  

I've opted to making myself numb to a lot of my life lately - a coping mechanism I'm quite acquainted with. I'm not suicidal, but I've yearned for the feeling of not having to think anymore. When I consider the scales as to whether existing is worth it anymore, I realize that I have experienced true love and true happiness, ultimately pushing me to believe that I would be okay with not existing anymore. I realize that life holds the potential for more of the aforementioned, but I think am okay with missing out on it if I also miss out on loneliness and unhappiness. I've only ever told this to counselors and doctors, which has been helpful, but I feel as if I am at my rope's end with no motivation to take any action at all.  

I realize the irony in the previous sentence as this post is an example of me taking action and so I'll conclude with a request for suggestions on how to regain motivation to exist. I genuinely do want to get better.",depression

"Nothing actually matters. I learned that our planet's wellbeing is declining rapidly. I already knew this, but the reality is that there is absolutely nothing any of us can do about it. We can recycle all we want, go vegan, ride bikes, etc. but the earth is on a downward spiral because of us.
Average temperatures are rising, sea levels are rising, and the ice caps are melting. In 20 years, polar bears will be extinct.
Global temperatures are getting so hot that places like New York where it is freezing in the winter will be more like South Carolina in the next 50 years.
In the next 100 years, our planet will look very different. Florida will probably be underwater. Many species of animals we commonly know will be extinct, or in danger of not existing anymore.
NOBODY is talking about the severity of this. It's like everyone only cares about what's happening now, but not thinking of future consequences.

"Stopped Zoloft cold-turkey, got a first-class ticket to crazy town I've been taking Zoloft since April 2016. I was on 75mg per day until September 2017, when I made the decision to taper down to 50mg per day. My psychiatrist said ""If you feel good, stop. If you feel worse, start again."" So, based on this well-rounded advice, I decided to just stop completely about a week ago. I told myself that surely 50mg is basically a negligible amount in the body, and it was probably a placebo at this point, right?

WRONG WRONG! SO WRONG!

Oh my god. The symptoms. The crazy. It was terrible. Monday I was at work and it felt more and more like I was outside myself - like my brain was running on its own, separate from me. I couldn't see properly - it was like being in a fog. After work, I went to the mall to try to interact with people and be normal, but my limbs were so heavy and my voice was so small I just dragged myself home.

I haven't been to work since Monday.

Tuesday, at home, I was OUT OF IT! It was like having a high fever. Nothing looked right, nothing felt right, I could hardly walk from my bedroom to the bathroom and back again. I could NOT speak. My heart was beating fast. The day passed in a blur of crying and napping...

Wednesday I took a pill again. Went to a doctor, got a sick note for the rest of the week. Cried, cried, cried. Everything made me cry. My thoughts were piling over each other a mile a minute but then, each time one formed, it was yanked away, up into the air. I couldn't get a grip. A friend came over and talked to me until I calmed down.

Today I took a pill again and am feeling better compared to the last few days (but still no work).

These ""withdrawal"" symptoms seem very extreme to me. Anyone else? Or are these actually just all of my mental issues resurfacing without the Zoloft to keep them at bay?

Any insight into quitting an SSRI would be most welcome.",depression

Transcrainal Magnetic Stimulation? I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was about 11 and have been medicated by the same psychiatrist since then.

"I've been reading this subreddit for awhile. Well, as the title says I have been reading this stuff for months. I think I'm depressed. I'm not sure why though. I have a really good long-term boyfriend, everything I need and a lot of things I just want. I've been ""depressed"" as long as I can remember. I think about killing myself every day, multiple times a day. Like, ""oh, i dropped something, well better kill myself"" ""Oh, I failed that math problem, you're worthless better kill yourself now"" I can barely shower most days. I don't know why my boyfriend hasn't broken up with me. Sometimes I wish he would so I could just kill myself. I feel really bad for him. 

I have anger issues I think, My moods change really fast, it is hard to keep up with them and I don't know why it happens. Most days I don't want to get out of bed. I don't have any friends. I always feel like everyone hates me. 

It would just be so much easier to die, why do people bother with life? What is the point? Everyone has always said that things ""get better"" but they don't really. They change and then something else sucks.

Nothing makes me happy, I don't enjoy doing anything that I can do by myself. I hate being alone, I hate my own company. I guess I just hate myself. Is this depression? Do I just suck? Maybe I'm just being dramatic. 

I wanna be a better person but I don't know how. My anxiety feels like a prison. It's really hard for me to leave the house. I HATE being around people, but I don't want to be alone either. Going to the store is a nightmare for me, the panic attacks and worrying I'm in someones way all the time. I only go in the middle of the night and never by myself. 

What is wrong with me? Why can't I do things normal people do? Is there any point in existing when you always feel miserable? This is the most awkward thing I've done in awhile, Time to take a nap and forget I posted here.  

( I didn't post to suicide watch because I've been having these thoughts so long I don't think I'll ever do it, even though I probably should. I'm just dramatic) ",depression
"I just feel like crap I figure I am a nice guy. I work hard, have no beef with people, my only vice is that I smoke weed, mostly for a laugh, but sometimes, like now, abusing it. I do my thing quietly. But my life is all smoke and mirrors. For the last lifetime, I'm 35, I've suffered untreated depression. I have major trust issues. I am broke and admittedly, poor. I no longer think I'm as smart as I thought I was. 



I have nobody I can trust anymore. I crushed and burned a few years ago, but decided to restart my life. I stayed celibate for a whole 3 years, didn't want to be involved with anybody till I was ready, worked night and day to get my business up and running, stopped smoking, kept really positive, prayed a lot and everything was starting to make sense. I won global awards, my business was featured in CNN, VIA, etc. Everything was working and I even started seeing someone and it was all starting to make sense, but just when everything is going OK, all manner of stumbling blocks came my way. I've lost my business, the girl who promised to have my back is now abroad following through on a promise to find a better suitor. After ghosting me for 3 weeks, she texted me to tell me she I going away, I've kept my distance and cut her off, but she keeps coming back. I'm broke, I owe a lot of money and nobody is helping me out so tomorrow will likely be forced to declare bankruptcy which means I've failed spectacularly again. My weed dealer told me he thinks I need professional help, but I don't trust anyone so getting help is out of the question and not negotiable. Either way I can't afford it. I can't trust my mum, cause she told me something important, that now in doubt is real. My dad is half hearted about this, and inspired a lot of negativity in my life when I was younger. He bid the reason I am the way I am. I have dealt with it, or so I think. I can't trust my best friends cause when you talk to them, instead of being my best friends, and have your back, they go talking. I have gone past suicidal, but to be honest, though I am in the abusive stage of my weed relationship, it has helped keep me together.

I've never hit this depth of shit before, and to be honest, I'm tired of existing. Positive thoughts and prayers haven't done much except make me become near obsessive and more depressed at bad outcomes. I am horrifically sad and scared and damaged. I know. For the past 6 weeks I been walking around with a lump in my throat. I tried crying. Couldn't. I am angry. I am hurt. I am very depressed. I am suicidal. I honestly don't know what else to do.",depression
"Life kicked us in the teeth this week I'll try to be brief, someone stole $1100 from us the same day that my wife (who is about 18 weeks pregnant) had an abnormal lab result.  The next day we had an ultrasound done and were told that the baby has a condition called anencephaly (baby will not fully form it's skull and brain) which is not compatible with life.  Our two choices are to terminate the pregnancy or continue to carry to term if the baby survived that long.  The baby would die within minutes, hours, or days if it survived birth.

I feel so many emotions other than just depression; rage, envy at friends who didn't have planned pregnancies, bitterness.

Just wanted to express that since we haven't really shared this news with anyone other than our parents.",depression
"Terrified of working In the UK we have a thing called benefits, it's for people who are unable to work. I've been on them for a year now and this week I got a letter saying my funds have been cut and I need to go to a meeting to discuss working in the future. I am terrified. I haven't worked since I left school 5 years ago. It has always been something I knew would trigger me into bad anxiety so I never think about it. As soon as I got the letter it all hit me and it really isn't helping my current mood. I'm terrified of working. I'm terrified of stress. I literally had to drop out of school and college because, the stress overwhelmed me and made me unwell. The stress and anxiety is triggering other things and I feel emotionally like a blob. Everyone I've spoken too just saw 'ah well it happens with every job you'll be fine' and 'it's okay to be nervous once you get a job it'll be ok' and it isn't helping at all because, I know I can't work without being in a state. It's happened when I volunteered in the past, it wasn't even stressful but even that lead me to a dark place. I can't even  begin to imagine what actual work will be like for me. I'm scared.",depression
"My life has fallen apart. I want to die My life on the outside seems perfect. I get good grades, I'm running a business, I am going to a science high school, but on the inside everything I do just makes me want to die. I'm 14, and I'm a bisexual atheist. My parents are homophobic super religious assholes. When I came out as an atheist they threatened to kick me out. I have multiple secret life's. I have been smoking, doing weed, juuling, Ive been contemplating suicide for weeks maybe months. But yesterday I tried to suffocate myself to death, I didn't go far enough to kill me but I almost blacked out. Today it did it again, my vision went fully black before I loosened the tie. I then looped it around my door Frame, put my neck through it, and dropped. The tie slipped out of place. I survived. I thought to myself, ""why can't I just die!"" I don't experience joy from anything anymore. Just drugs and the thought of being asphyxiated to death. What the hell is wrong with me. My best friend thinks I'm a douche bag and isn't talking to me. What the hell is wrong with me. Everyone in my school thinks I'm a loser, just because I had anxiety, ADHD and ocd in elementary school. I just wanna run away, or die. But I know I cant do either of those things. I have too much invested here. I don't have enough time to cash out my assets and run. I can only live, or go somewhere where I don't need money. Death. What the hell is wrong with me. There's a voice in my head, and it's rather soothing, it tells me I'd be better off dead. I don't want to listen but each time I tighten the grip on my neck, each time my blood vessels in my face bulge, each time my vision darkens, the call to the void strengthens. What the hell is wrong with me. ",depression
"Nothing, but a gigantic mess. I use two personalities to certain situations or a group people. 
1. A bubbly, outgoing, for the laughs, happy thoughts,  loud ""hype man"" that forces himself to surround himself with people to conquer his isolation from others but only hurting himself for leaving himself too open for people to take advantage for their own deeds and backstabbing, leading to many trust issues I have pent up inside. (Also desperate for  being the main centre of attention.)

2.  A suicidal bastard, who makes never-ending jokes about his father who left him and issues with his single-mother, and makes white lies about the smallest things, in which each and every lies continues to haunt him.

And when I get home, those personalities fade away for the next day and I'm just an empty shell that isolates himself from people and his family. It's usually a week or two I cry myself to sleep praying that someone would help or understand me to the least. Because, two friends I trust so much, one I've been with for 5 years and the other a very good childhood friend other than my supposed ""friend"" who are pessimistic, judge people, and selfish to the core.

I wasn't physically abused by any means. But mostly verbal and emotional abuse for most of my life that it can be to the point where a person would kill themself, not being able to handle it anymore. Surprisely, I haven't caused a single attempt of hurting myself or killing myself, just self-hatred for being the way I am. I try my best to do the things I enjoy like video games and art and I wish to try other things that peak my interest, but I'm afraid of being judge of not being original or that I'll trying to be like someone. 

Tl:dr - I'm a fucking loser stucking a web of lies and proclaims from others that also tries to be his true self but has an unhealthy habit of hiding behind two masks leading to my trust issues, anxiety, screaming to myself, crying myself to sleep, and insecure. Help.",depression
"Nobody gets it Everyone tells me that I need to talk about my feelings. My therapists, psychiatrists, friends. It never pays off. Every friend I make takes all my ""feelings"" too personally. They do whatever the fuck they want in our relationship and then when I say I'm upset about something they spin it around and make me a bad guy. 

Nobody can handle having a mature conversation about feelings. It's always gotta be some dumb argument about how my feelings are invalid because of their feelings. Why cant we just fucking talk. 

And then heaven forbid I even mention my depression. I would never dare to tell someone talking to me about their depression ""I get it I'm depressed too."" Fuck that. You dont get it. It isn't the same. 

The best is friends who tell you what your amazing therapist told you is wrong. My therapist taught me that my severe depression cant be cured. All I can do is learn to cope. I thought that made sense. I was okay with it. Stop waiting for the depression to go away and learn to face it because it will always be there. That's the most helpful and real thing anyone has ever said to me. Now I have friends telling me that's bullshit and living with the idea it's never going away isn't healthy. 

My therapist also told me the first step towards getting better is to face my feelings instead of distracting myself from them. So I started doing that. He told me it would get worse before it got better. He was right. My friends cant handle who I am when I face my feelings. It has made me emotionally sick. I push everyone away even more than I did before I tried to change. 

So what's the fucking point? If I face them I'm fucked, if I ignore them I'm fucked. Nobody will stand by me. I've got one good friend left and he cant handle it anymore either. I dont want to be alone. I've never felt more alone than I do today. ",depression
"I screwed up with bills and disappointed my girlfriend. Quick background, I've been diagnosed with major depressive and anxiety disorder.

I'm usually the one at our house who opens and sorts out our bills. Recently I gave my girlfriend two of her bills that she needed to pay and she read that one of them was an instalment bill that was overdue.

I didn't realize at the time that it was the last notice for the bill and after it was overdue, the whole payment would be transferred to a collection agency.

She got extremely upset and told me how disappointed and angry she was at me. I apologized, told her I was sorry and started to search what we could do next.

Fortunately we can ask the collection agency to pay the whole cost via instalments so there is really no harm done, but I feel so awful by this whole situation.

I feel like I betrayed her trust and I feel so useless. I am angry at how stupid I am for not noticing the whole thing.",depression
"I need answers... Hello, I'm an 18 years old boy, I've been depressed since I can remember, as a kid, my parents would always fight on different topics, if they couldn't find something to fight about, they'd create something, my father is drunk 70% of the time since I know him, even if he has diabetes, ulcer and hernia. My mother lost herself trying to keep the family togheter, one night when I was 13 they had a serious fight, I was just passing by the kitchen window when I saw my father with a knife in his hand and the other hand on my mother's throat, I think that's the moment when something inside me changed, I started developing social anxiety, embracing loneliness. My first thought when I'd wake up would be ""maybe today I will get lucky and I will get hit by a car"", I've slept countless nights with a knife in my hand, maybe one night I will have the courage to do it. About my social life, at school I'd be the freaky kid who doesn't talk much, who doesn't go out, who'd sit at his desk alone, I've had a couple of friends, but I never discussed my problems and my thoughts with them, they wouldn't understand, also I've had 3 girlfriends, all of them broke up with me after realising what kind of mess I am, I've never said ""I love you"", not even to my family, because they never did.

Lately my depression got worse, I'm sleeping 1-2 hours every night, my taste for food is gone, I'm eating just so I won't feel sick anymore, my suicidal thoughts are back too, I belive what's eating me alive it's the lack of conectivity people have with each other, how can they be so careless? so selfish? and I don't know/understand why I'm different, I'm feeling like I've meet the same people in different bodies all over again, the good and true people are dying everyday one by one killing themselves because they can't take how the world is anymore. I've thought multiple times to change my life, follow politics, maybe I could change something, but does this world really deserves to be changed? I'm just lost, confused...and looking for answers...

"Wish I had someone to talk to This year has been so far the most difficult for me. Last year I met someone online that for some reason I could just open up to about everything. I didn't matter what it was from the smallest issue to the biggest I could just say it.

He called me names, picked on me and bullying me about my depression and now I have no one I can talk to. I feel like killing myself almost every day and at night I lay in bed and think I don't want to die but it seems like the only way to deal with the pain is to either just do it or keep cutting. I've been putting off going to the doctors for a long time because I guess I'm scared about telling someone that I don't exactly trust about my problems. I don't want the doctor to think I need to be going to therapy but I think I do. I don't really know what to do, only 2 people know now that I talk to that I have depression but they don't care. I only told them because after her leaving they noticed I've been getting distant and less talkative in a way and if I don't tell them what's going on everyone assumes shit and makes up bullshit.

"I've been on a upswing and trying to keep the momentum... Give my story a chance to inspire you. April of this year I found out my wife, my everything really who is from Europe not only cheated on me... but did so with the one person I really looked up to, my older brother.. I know right? I really leaned on him for emotional support after our dad died from cancer in 2012.

I'm sure most of you know how complicated your feelings get after being cheated on, but imagine adding the awkwardness and division from the whole family. Just typing this and reading it in my head I'm feeling a panic attack coming on. But that does not matter because I want to tell my story to lead by example. Btw even if this doesn't help you, up vote this if you think this might help someone. Most of you know what it's like to feel isolated in your personal problems.

Some post I read on this sub sickens me because it would seem some people are just here to enjoy throwing pity parties for themselves for the most trivia things. I'm trying to find a post to relate with and I'm reading stuff like ""hot people piss me off because they get all the chicks!"" Really dude??? Do you know what's having the conflicting emotions of hate and love you have for people in your life using your mind as a battlefield?? Do you know the hopeless and insecure feelings of being betrayed in every way imaginable?? All on top of watching your best friend slowly die from cervical cancer? I'm not here to having a pissing contest with anyone of who's life is sadder... but it would seem so on this sub are. Pathetic in my opinion.

Back to my original point the last week or so I have been doing well emotionally, mentally, spirituality, and even physically because I'm actually eating like a normal person!! Not only do I have to endure the pain of my life situation, but I have to see the worry on my mothers face because I always had dark circles under my eyes, and barely spoke... not to mention I was looking so anorexic. 
I could literally feel my mind dissolving me as a person, and I was positive suicide was inevitable. Until week and half ago I felt that could never change. 

Don't think I'm just a natural born happy person either because I was diagnosed and medicated for severe depression back when I was 14 years old… And 29 now for the record. Eventually wean myself off of the medication by the time I was 19 because I didn't want to rely on it anymore. I really push back emotionally because I wanted to climb out of the dark hole I was in. I feel that's early lesson is what's helping me through now.

I don't want to go through the whole story of my depression due to the cheating and my sick friend because I already made a huge long post on it a little bit ago so if you're really curious I'm sure you can find it. Long story short I was tired of being sad. Mostly because I could see my mom stressing the fuck out. My biggest stress in life is when people worry over me But I really didn't know what to do… 

I was in my moms hot tub alone sulking about everything in my life. I mean everything... I had a really rough child/teenhood growing up. Abuse mentally and physically was a constant looming threat for my father when he was on drugs. It got so bad my mother and I had to leave everything in our hometown behind to run to a state we've never been to before to hide. Mix all that is the new akward teen that started school midsemester you're bound to have some emotional issues later on in life. That thought lead to another thought of a bad experience, which led to another. I was getting depressed just opening those scabs back up… But then it just hit me… 
How do I feel about those moments now? How did I grow as an adult? Did the experiences change me for the better or the worse? The conclusions I was coming to we're surprising me. It's like I lived multiple lives and totally forgot about them till now. My entire life has been based off of tragedy… Those tragedies took lots of things for me... but in a weird since they've given me much more better things. I'm tracing lines way back in the past and realized that if these certain bad things didn't happen I wouldn't have the great things I have today, be it wisdom or social opportunities. 

I got to tell you guys I almost got excited that I was going through these hard times now... almost hahaha because I decided then and there that I was going to let it make me and not break me. 

I am still sad.. every single day even after these revelations my mind wanders and I get really angry or really depressed. I identify that's what I'm feeling but do not play into them. I realize I feel sad… But I won't be sad if that makes sense. In other words I will not embody sadness. I will let depression be a byproduct of how terrible life can be… But I will not become a byproduct of depression. 

Now just because I figured this out doesn't mean there's not points throughout my day that I don't have to remind myself of that... far from the that actually! It's a daily struggle. But a struggle I plan to win.
I'm in a good place right now and I hope it lasts even through the lonely holiday seasons that are coming up. Even as I type this I am listening to the album Tallahassee by the Mountain goats… If you don't know who they are or what that is the guy writes a lot a concept albums about his divorce which still cuts  me like knives… but just like we are all on the depression sub Reddit to relate with someone i related to the music... obviously. I'm not bitter anymore when I listen to it. It's more like therapy session to me now. I know everybody's mental state, stories, and life views differ from one to the next. What works for me many not you. But if my story inspired at least one person I would be quite satisfied. If you have any questions about my posts, myself, or just a lonely and need someone to talk to you don't be afraid to shoot me a message. It wouldn't hurt. Who knows it might make you feel better. Life doesn't suck… The world does… And I'm done allowing the world to control my feelings… Who's coming with me?

Again even if this didn't help you personally, if you think this post can help someone up vote it please… Let's support each other instead of dragging each other down into the deep dark hole of depression. 
Stay safe guys ✌🏼

"I dont know where I'm going with this I've had depression (among other things, anxiety, PTSD etc) for over a decade now and it never seems to get better, every time I *feel* like I'm improving or getting better, I'll crash back to rock bottom from one small thing, it could be a 'friend' I thought I had ignored me for over a week, someone could be horribly rude at the store to me or I'll over eat and punish myself...hell I'll even crash from PTSD flashbacks about how much of a failure I've become. 

I will just cut contact with everyone outside my house, including those online (my only social contact besides my sibling and partner), I delete/deactivate all social media and attempt and its just a vicious cycle I've had for as long as I know. My one IRL friend I had moved away earlier this year so my only reason to leave the house has come and gone, I spend every day in bed besides work. I've been to psychiatrists to try fix myself but I can't afford long term treatment. (I work part time but I'm under the poverty line, I do live in a country with health care but 10 sessions a year is not enough for what I need according to professionals) I still function outside the house thanks to my 'mask' my mother taught me to use. 

All my grandparents and my parents are long dead, so I have no one because I'm the kind of person who looks after others, no one looks after me. I do have a significant other but I just...I don't know anymore, they help me but they cant fix my problems and I wouldnt expect them to.

"It's terrifying & humiliating how easy other people find everyday existence. When you think about hopping in the car and driving--to the grocery store, to the mall, anywhere--you probably don't even think about how being able to drive at all gives you quite a degree of freedom & autonomy. When you think about going to work at a job you've had for years, you probably don't even think about the admirable amount of responsibility, care, and presence of mind went into earning yourself the security you now feel every day. When you think about all of the people you've dated or even just hooked up with, you most likely don't even consider that you have, at least once, managed to make the most real & intense connection with another soul that a human being is capable of--or at the least, that by hooking up you have, at least once, placed yourself in one of the truest positions of power over another.

I'm probably a 4 or 5; with makeup I can be a 6 or 7 at most if I have tons of time, and I have no charisma due to social anxiety from high school & a gentle but kind of bland personality. But that's beside the point. 

The point is that it terrifies me that these everyday things are so insurmountable for me. I'm currently standing in a crowded subway car, and it absolutely kills me to think how for all these people, these things--driving, job, love, sex--are just a backdrop, an assumed facet of life. For me they're unimaginable; I'm serious. I cannot see a future for myself where I enjoy what others take for granted. 

I don't know who can truly relate to me, but if you can then you've tasted how it feels to be severely below the curve and aware of it; how it feels to be powerless to live a real, true life.",depression

"How do you know if you are depressed or suicidal. I know this sounds like an odd question. Shouldn't I just know?

Well, I have had feelings like this for the last 10 years or so. On and off mind you, but there are happening more frequent. 

Nothing matters, I don't matter, nothing that brings me joy matters and I have seriously thought about what it would be like to just end it. Even if there isn't an afterlife. 

I've pushed back these feelings by thinking that I am just being a baby, that people have it worse then you and you are just looking for attention. This could be true, but it feels like I have gotten worse. 

I have not told anyone about this, and if my depressive side slips I just laugh it off like I am just having a bad day. 

I feel like nothing will get better for me and that there is no point in going on. I'll be turning 28 next month and I already feel that there is no hop in things getting better. That I should end the burden that I clearly am on my parents and just end it. 

Of course, I'm sure soon I will just delete this post and play it off like ""Ah, you idiot, things aren't so bad"" Thus the cycle will begin again until maybe someday, I really won't be able to laugh anymore. ",depression

"Waiting for a miracle. -Happy Halloween. Hello, I'm not new to this sub, but I don't think I've ever actually posted here before. I thought I'd post here seeing as I have literally nothing else to do (in the nicest way possible). I'm from the UK, so when you turn 16, you're done with high-school, however, My year (2017) was a 'test' year so to speak.  A law was passed that made it so you had to be in full time education, or work with training (an apprenticeship) until you were 18. Now, I have been depressed since I was about 12, but I had planned to go to college or sixth from upon finishing high-school regardless of mental health. I took my final exams in 2017 for high-school and did about as well as I thought I would (considering I didn't do one second of revision). This boosted my confidence a lot, so I thought I'd try doing Chemistry, Biology, and Film Studies (random) for the next 2 years. After the first week or two of sixth form, I decided it wasn't for me, and left. Unfortunately, though, it was still mandatory that I did \*something\*. So, I tried a different sixth form and attempted 3 different A- levels - Media studies, Photography, and Film studies (again). I managed to stay in this one for six months roughly (all the while being intensely depressed, starting to lose hope, and running out of reasons to 'stick around'). In April 2018, I quit that sixth form because I was starting to \*lose my cool\*. I stayed off of school from April to September 2018, but, I really did have to find a new place. I tried getting a job as an IT technician (one of my few hobbies) and I hoped it would turn into an apprenticeship, but, it's my dream to be in the media like my sister (Tanya Burr, give her a google). The IT place was nice-ish, but it was just a bunch of socially awkward, middle aged men that physically embodied 'dead-end'. SO, \*sigh\* I enrolled on a Creative Media Production course (level 3, the level under Degree level). I was immediately put off by the way the teachers purposefully made it sound like the course was impossible to pass (presumably to deter the people that weren't going to try very hard). Though, it did a pretty bloody good job of deterring me too - as I knew I was on the verge of being mentally unfit for education. So 1 week in, I am given a ""portfolio"" which is essentially a scrap book of work, to show the lecturers what you know about the subject, so they can get an idea of your skills with editing, photography, camera work, etc. However, it was assessed as 'Pass' or 'Fail' so if you didn't know much about media or editing, you were essentially screwed from the get-go, as they made a pretty dismal attempt to teach people how to use Adobe Premiere Pro, or a DSLR. One teacher left to do something else at the college, so we were left with 2 teachers, and a brand new Lady that was very kindhearted, and meant well, but was brand new to leaving. A few weeks later we lost another teacher (the only one that I would call a decent teacher). It was bad enough already because i'm only in college Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday and I have a total of 4 teachers for all the same subject. I feel like I'm rambling here, but this year has by far, been the worst year of my life. I am aimlessly clawing at anything that looks like it could be even the slightest bit of help. On top of all of this shit, I'm learning to drive. I got unlucky with my first theory test because all the questions were extremely ambiguous, and not what i've experienced in practices or anything. I've got my next test on the 9th of November. I'm worried that if I fail it, i'll get pushed over the edge. ",depression

"How to help someone who is not ready to accept help? Hey guys, if you don't mind I could use the perspective of someone who's been there. 

This is about me and my friend, both girls in college. She is severely depressed, has been for most of her teenage years and is very deep in that hole. I know I can't lift her out of it, I can offer to find her a therapist, make the calls, get her there and back but in the end; the decision to give it a chance needs to be hers. 

We've spoken about it a lot of times, why she doesn't want to go to therapy and is afraid it won't work. She's scared she's been feeling this way for too long, that it's too late to get help; that she deserves to feel this way because she's responsible for all of it, that she's not worth someone's efforts, that she doesn't deserve to feel any better. She knows all the ins and outs of how it's medical, chemical, how she's being unfair to herself and her view is skewed, how all her reasons for not wanting to give it a chance are just excuses. It's free in my country, you don't even have to commit to it right away because there's 5 zero-commitment sessions with every new therapist. She knows all this. And sometimes it feels like she's actually hearing me and actually considering it, but in the end she always shuts down.

There's this truly beautiful amazing person who is battling all this shit she doesn't deserve and I wish I could take it all away from her but I can't. I would move the planet to get her help if she allowed me, but so far she won't. Her life is so far from over and there's so many wonderful things out there and I know therapy doesn't help everyone, but most people benefit from it and she hasn't even tried. She is not actively suicidal but essentially just waiting for her life to be over. I'm sure you all know the feeling. And it hurts so much to watch because she doesn't deserve any of it, she doesn't deserve the way she's been treated and the way she treats herself and there is no objective reason holding her back, just that she's her own worst enemy. I know it's depression protecting itself. Some days I feel like I'm talking only to the depression part, and not to her underneath at all. Some days she actually listens. But I don't know what to say anymore. 

If you've ever been in her situation and did end up deciding to do something about it, what was it that needed to click for you? What changed? If you're currently in her situation, what would you *want* to hear? Even if it won't be any kind of wake-up call, what can I say to make it any more bearable for even just a moment? I want to be there for her and I know I can't make that decision for her and if she's not ready she's not ready but I'm not ready to give up hope. ",depression

"Relapsed Hey, college student here. I've been experiencing depression for roughly eight years straight now with my twentieth birthday in January. I don't want to make this too lengthy, but there are things I want to get off my chest because I'm alone with my thoughts right now and sometimes it's just best to air dirty laundry.

As for the depression, I can really remember it starting around middle school. I was always told I was a gifted kid and before I knew it suddenly my grades were lower than average. While I've dealt with suicidal thoughts and something close to an attempt in the past, I'm choosing to leave that out of this because I feel it isn't part of this situation.

I had a brief period in my life where I seemed happy, lasting roughly the last six months of 2017. I thought things were going to be okay and I was out of the woods. I'm back to having entire days where I feel I cannot, and do not, get out of bed. Classes that should thrill me seem overwhelming and by the time my day is done all I want to do is sleep. I feel like I am letting down my professors, family, significant other, and anyone else who associates with me. I despise counciling and medication does nothing for me. I cannot imagine getting out of this hole once again.

Family - ""Oh wow... so ____ tell us about your classes or what you liked to drink throughout college!"" 

My family has given up on me. They all have worked on a cattle ranch from birth and look at me as extremely lazy for being a pizza delivery guy. All of my friends that I could call actual relatable friends all have kids now and have way bigger things to worry about, understandably. I just wish I had more than three friends at 25 years old. 

My depression had really started to take hold when I was 22 and doing nothing but working nights and then staying up until noon playing games. I am not about that vampire life, let me tell you. 
It was around this time I kicked my dabbing of THC concentrate into high gear and was taking 5 - 10 dabs a day because I was so lonely at night. 
Is this what is causing my depression and anxiety? No. Did it help? Definitely not. Do I have the willpower or motivation to change any amount of instant gratification out of my life for an overall good outcome? Hell no.

My loving yet manipulative girlfriend of two years cheated on me. And has since told me she cheated on me multiple times while living together, once with one of my friends. I have lost all motivation to try and better myself. I gave my all for this girl that I really believe I connected with through music, games, general ideologies, everything. She told me she loved me every day and made me cute nerdy  things I liked and really made me feel a way I've never felt before. A genuine connection and comfort with someone. I didn't mind that she would go through my phone or Facebook sometimes because I am god damn loyal to any girl I'm with, especially someone that does everything else so perfectly. I tried my hardest every day to show her I loved her or to prove through her insecurities that she was the most beautiful girl to me.  I tried my hardest for two years not to become complacent with the girl I truly believed to be a one of a kind person that's hard/impossible to find.  We spent most of our moments together, and I feel so empty now. 

I shouldn't be this way but this is how it is at the moment. I hate myself for even posting this because there are people on the other side of the world getting bombed or starved, which sounds like real problems compared to some middle class suburban white kid's depression and anxiety brought on by general lack of motivation and routine. 

What is my problem? I have tried college for aerospace and computer networking, both of which were fields I felt no passion in and therefore never pursued more than one job in the space.  

I really love the reddit community and the you all have to say for the silliest of topics! I'm hoping maybe someone will drop by and at least help me understand what is wrong or where I can begin working on myself.

I've named it 'a fractured mind' and it's on wordpress if anyone is interested in looking.  Any feedback would be great.  Below is my first (short) post.  

  

Reality or fiction

Have you ever caught that glimpse of a shadow out the corner of 
your eye? That brief moment when your brain hasn't decided yet 
if what you're seeing is really there or not. When the thoughts first come, these moments are spaced out, fleeting, barely perceptible amongst  the everyday thoughts. Then slowly these fleeting illusions, those things you put down to a trick of the light, they start to take over. Insidious vines of self doubt have begun to wind they're way though the pulsating network of neurons in your brain and by the time you realise they've already tightened the coil. That damp stain on the corner of the kitchen has moved again, twisting upside down, it's edges blurring. The walls, they're breathing to a slow rhythmic beat and the patterns on the wall grow and shrink.

The outside world looking so hollow grey, you retreat into the safety of your fractured mind. You return to the darkness so you can continue being that ever gracious host to your ever hungry parasite. This sycophant that whispers in your ear, that scratches underneath your skull. The further you slide away from objective truth the further you fall towards that place where the illusion you could once dismiss becomes reality. The dendrites in your brain are suffocating and those once clear connections in your mind are fading. The zealot leech which now controls your mind is creeping between your grey matter and as it does those paths that once seemed so clear blur and fade into the background. the shroud of darkness and confusion falls so heavy it hides the fact that they were ever there and any residual clarity disappears beneath it.
And so on day you'll find yourself staring into a mirror and the face looking back, it's no longer you. The hyphae of this parasitic vine, it's taken you back down into that catacombs of your past. When you look in the that mirror trying to recognize a piece of you're self that hasn't been shattered by self doubt you hear that whisper in your ear ' Don't be scared, you're safe now'. And,maybe it's right. Maybe this warped network of dendrites and axons is where you belong A certain comfort sweeps through you as you accept that these blurred realities are your reality and you breathe a sigh of relief because now you can finally rest, because now you are finally home.

"Switching from latuda to lamictal So to preface this I've been off my Latuda for a week. I was on 20mg for 3 years, and I've always had a hard time not vomiting it up. Last Monday, I had had enough and was going to see a new pdoc in a week, and called my family doctor to ask if I should continue taking the Latuda, since I wasn't keeping it down anyway. My family doctor said no.

A week later, yesterday, everything finally came to a head. My mania was in full force and at 3:30 in the morning I'm on the phone screaming at my friend and then breaking down in tears. I had my appointment with my new pdoc later that day and she decided Lamictal would be a good fit since I wanted something weight neutral.

I was feeling pretty hopeful last night since I actually kept the first pill down and felt relatively okay. I slept better than I had been. But since I arrived at work I can't stop shaking and have been holding back tears all day. I'm stuck in between staring off into space at my desk to feeling nothing at all to very intense anxiety. I'm also on Xanax but don't want to take it because I'll be at the Cavs game tonight and would like to enjoy a beer without blacking out. 

All I've heard/read is that the Lamictal is some miracle drug, people say they've got their life back. I know it's only Day 1 but can you all share your experiences with this?

"Medication (Depakote) & School Behavior Hi, all. Very long post - Please bare with me. I do need help and although I started this thinking this would be a paragraph,  it seems every detail is important, so here goes. 

My lovely 14 1/2 yr old son is struggling. He does not have a bipolar diagnosis (I promise there's a good reason I'm posting here tho!), at least as of yet, but is continuing to be assessed by the psychiatrist he's been seeing since late July. 

He has currently been diagnosed with ADHD and trying to rule out oppositional defiant disorder (past tentative diagnosis) and intermittent explosive disorder, among other possible reactive behavior disorders. 

We have an extensive family history of bipolar, including several people on mother's side (including my mom), my oldest son, and their biological father, so of course that's not yet ruled out. 

My son has a long and extensive history of behavioral issues at school. He used to occasionally have explosive episodes at home when he was much younger, like elementary school age (never violent or attacking, more internal), but they didn't occur often and haven't in years. 

At home, he is almost always calm, pleasant, respectful, and honestly just nice to be around. Of course he has some typical adolescent/teen hiccups but seriously, for the most part he's great. He is obedient and often cheerful. He has a 3 yr old sister that he is amazingly kind, loving, and patient with - she considers him her best friend. We also have a cat that he is very responsible and caring with (so basically I'm saying I don't think he's a psychopath)...

And yet... At school, I get calls nearly every day. I can't count how many times he's been suspended over the past few years, and don't even get me started on detention and ISS. 

He can be generally defiant over simple requests, develop oppositional relationships with certain teachers, and can escalate into cussing out a teacher if he feels cornered. If a teacher (probably especially male) touches him in a way he feels is aggressive (grabbing his backpack, or today - aggressively pushing him out of a classroom), he will definitely cuss them out and the situation goes downhill from there. 

In terms of a typical episode, it's not so much fighting as just consistent defiance of simple requests. I mean, he's  gotten into a couple of scuffles but that's not often the case. In 7th grade (he just started 9th), he had a meltdown after a rough day and destroyed his school tablet in the hallway by slamming it repeatedly onto the floor. They suspended him and filed criminal charges for destruction of school property and a few days later, an officer came to arrest him at school (he completed a 6 month diversion program and it was dismissed). He also had to go to the alternative school for several weeks. Prior to that, I'd been to the school multiple times about my concerns and tearfully asking for help with resources to deal with the issues at school. Despite this, no real counseling or help with a plan from the school. Just more constant issues and more punishment. 

He just started 9th grade and his high school has the resources to be as supportive as they possibly can. I tried all through middle school to get interventions but all they could do was suspend him and punish him, which never helped at all. Never did they tell me we should do a Behavior Intervention Plan - I never even knew that was a thing and I'd been trying to get a diagnosis for him forever at that point (I won't even go into that!). But he finally has at least an initial diagnosis, starting medication, and the new high school truly seems to be doing their best to be on board with me in all we're trying to do to support my son and help him to improve. 

He may very well not be able to stay in a traditional public school, I don't yet know, but private schools aren't a practical option for us financially and the charter schools in the area aren't suitable academically. He does not have any intellectual issues and has the potential to do great academically...However, the ADHD is not yet really treated, and his grades have suffered in the past couple of years. We do have a couple of possible alternatives we can consider if things don't improve, but not sure yet. So anyway. 

School just started a month ago but I've already been working extensively with them. They have a behavior intervention specialist, a crisis specialist, his counselor, and his assistant principal, in addition to what seems to be a set of teachers who genuinely want to help my son be successful. We've had multiple therapists and they typically say ""oh he's doing fine, we can stop for now"" or some version of that - although the surface hasn't even been scratched in terms of serious cognitive behavioral therapy. I'm hoping for the best with a new therapist he starts with next week. I truly believe this needs to be both consistent and extensive. 

I'm getting there - I promise. I feel like you need the full background to understand what I'm really begging for help with, in terms of advice and experience. So, medication. His psychiatrist started him on 1mg of Intuniv in late July, then titrated up to 2 mg after a month. This began over the summer, when everything is pretty chill. 

By the second week of school starting (his freshman year), I had started getting the calls again. He's only been on the 2mg Intuniv for about a month, so it may still need more time, but the school issues were not lessening in frequency. However, they may, MAYBE maybe maybe be slightly improving in intensity. 

It seems my son is slowly gaining a slightly better ability to calm himself more quickly and de-escalate. He has opened up to his assistant principal, the behavior specialist, and counselor - even cried in their offices. He's called me from school crying when he got in trouble, so frustrated with the situation and with himself. He listens to them and discusses different ways of doing things and solutions. These were not things he did before. He was 100% closed off to all school administrators in middle school. I'm certain a large part is due to how supportive the school administration is trying to be, but I also am wondering if some of it is medication effects.

So here we are. His psychiatrist is concerned about a few things in terms of the Intuniv: the issues at school are not lessening in frequency, and also my son told me one morning last week, while crying, after he woke up late (being tired and rushed causes him to get agitated quickly), that he ""wakes up every morning depressed"". The Dr. was concerned about him seeming more weepy/low mood than before. Of course, I think the crying may be a good thing! He seems able to express the feelings he's pent up forever more openly, but I understand his concerns that it could also be a potentially negative side effect of the Intuniv on my son's mood. 

So he decided to switch him to Depakote instead and see if the school behavior improves. I've been really worried, as has my husband who's a pharmacist, and even had a close family friend (a nurse) tell me a while back, when talking about our kids and their struggles, ""just don't let them put him on any serious shit like depakote."" I've been doing nothing but reading on it constantly. BUT! We trust his dr. and honestly if by some miracle it helps, and he's healthy, we're happy with that and I'm fine with it. He took his first dose today (250 mg delayed release), then same tomorrow and starting Friday he'll go to 500mg a day (250 twice a day). The doc said if it's agreeing with him or not, we should have an idea within a week. Of course, I'm assuming if we can get this to a decent level behaviorally, we will then need to assess something to help with the ADHD symptoms but right now I'm just so desperate for the behavior to improve. 

So please, someone out there, tell me - did you experience any similar issues in school? What helped and what didn't? Experiences with depakote for you, your kids, etc? I adore my son and I just want to learn and know and do all I can to help him as much as possible. And I super need some hope. Every day is just an hourly waiting game for my phone to ring from the school, and I'm exhausted. This is so long and I'll probably regret making this so long and delete it by tomorrow. 

Thanks, y'all. Seriously.

"I got her hospitalized and shes on injections but... Basically i posted this a while back 
Since then about 10 days ago i got her hospitalized and she hated me for it calling the worst boyfriend ever. She kept calling me to bring her food and other stuff. I told her that i know shes been sleeping around with at least 5+ men and i told her about it over the phone and she said im nosey and hung up..Mind you i know because she tells the whole world and it caught up to me because she talks to much.
Once she was hospitalized she refused meds and according to the nurse she was suppose to go to court with the doctor to get forced medicated which im guessing is now. I asked her today about it and she says shes getting injections every 2 weeks and is on 4 pills that she won't tell me.
THE PROBLEM is shes still going out and drinking and while the injections are making her drowsy and sleepy..She still has the need to go out and DRINK and fuck around.


She doesn't plan on working and is going to apply for disability which shes only woerked part time jobs in the past prettty much her average from the past 4-5 years has been 14000/yr but im not sure how disability works but shes being pretty lazy and not even being a mother.

I still live with her because i live with her family and if i live i screw the family over & i need to save more money to move out and i need to go to court to try to get full custody of my daughter. I have ACS involved and all her family have given their testimonies that she is not well and doesnt take care of our daughter.
my question to some of you out there is what help can i get her or is it pretty much her own responsibility?
This is her 2nd time getting hospitalized btw She has worked after the first time being diagnosed with bipolar disorder & recently quit both her jobs She has a 15k debt

"Embrace Capitalism to Solve Impulse Spending and Uneven Productivity This won't work for everyone, but works for me. I meant for this to be short, but it turned into a novella.

**tl;dr:** 

Capitalism can switch mania from a financial liability to an asset. 


**Problem:**

Previously, I'd buy entertainment products. Usually related to some game or another. Games gave me something to think about. Continuous thought gave me something to obsess over. Obsession gave me something to act irresponsibly with when manic. Add the competitive nature of the games and a naturally aggressive personality and I had a real problem. Irresponsibility taxed my bank account. Mania taxes!


**Why we buy:**

To alleviate boredom. For a distraction. For entertainment.


**Contextual Problems:**

Most problems caused by bipolar or otherwise, are contextual.

Having so much energy you wanna run 500 miles without stopping is a problem if you're expected to sit quietly in a cubicle, working on something boring which requires a high level of attention. Having so much energy you wanna run 500 miles is an asset, when running with friends. Same mental/physical state in both cases. The only thing required to shift manic energy from liability to asset is to change the context in which the mental/physical state exists.

Impulse spending is likewise contextual. Impulse buying frivolous things will cause you financial harm. It'll cause you stress, and strain to your relationships. Impulse buying business supplies can lead to profits, with little planning or mental effort.

Yesterday, I bought $300 worth of exotic wood. I wasn't planning on it. I was pretty much frothing at the mouth and happened to drive past a wood shop. I knew I was going to buy something. I could feel it bubbling up. I let myself go nuts. I bought every piece of quarter inch stock I felt even mildly drawn to. I nearly wiped out the store.

Then I went home and did nothing but draw, cut and route paddles for 6 hours. Now I have 42 paddles ready to be sanded and finished. Usually I can get $40-$80 out of a paddle, depending on the wood. I created ~$1,400 expected profit, by impulse spending $300 on business supplies. Everything ends up consumed by someone else, with cash flowing back to me, ready for more spending.

So at the end of the thing, I have no wood and no paddles and more money than I started with. Space and cash beats abandoned novelties junking the place up. I can use the money for more wood to make more paddles to make more money, to buy more wood to make more paddles to make more money, to buy more wood to make more paddles to make more money, to buy more wood to make more paddles to make more money. Ad nauseum.

It generates about $2k in profit a month, independent of my day job. So now I have a cash flow to do impulsive things with, which can be considered risk-free, as if all this money vanished, I'd still have my day job. This is incredibly freeing as it lets me impulse spend without guilt, so long as I don't exceed my risk-free cash flow. My wife is very submissive (inspiration for paddles in the first place) and has no expectation of this money being used for anything household related. It's a self-propelled entertainment budget.

I also recommend partnering with a masochist. You're going to hurt your lover. It's inevitable. That's what bipolar does. There is no reason to fight it. Like most problems, hurting your lover is contextual. The problem isn't the pain caused, pain is neutral. The context that pain exists in is what matters. Hurt a normal person and you've damaged the relationship. Hurt a masochist, and you've enhanced it. Most masochists enjoy uneven treatment, so a partner flipping from nice to nasty in pseudo-random cycles suits them ideally. My wife doesn't love me *in spite* of the pain I cause her. She loves me *because* of the pain I cause her. Pain is a welcome feature of the relationship, not a bug to be squelched.


**More Novelty:**

If you're fortunate enough to live in the USA, your horizons are unconstrained. I used some of the cash from paddles to buy a rental unit. Now I'm a landlord too. Graduated to full blown capitalist. Becoming a landlord was an entirely different experience and process. Looking at houses/condos. Driving all over with my wife. Figuring out what papers to send where. Yelling at financiers. Tons of new stimuli to satisfy manic boredom. 

I'm bootstrapping a CBD candy shop my wife. She has health problems that CBD is effective against. Instead of us paying for her CBD, capitalism enables her CBD *to pay us*. Whatever dosages she needs. Doesn't matter. So long as the cash flow is positive, it can be sustained for eternity. This involved sourcing materials and equipment. Figuring out where to sell from. How to make the math work. How to brand the candy. How much CBD we could cram into a Jolly Rancher clone without making it taste like rancid leaves. Which flavors worked best. Tons of things to create amusement. Tons out outlets to buy stuff.

Sometimes a bootstrapped business never materializes. I never buy the gear or supplies. I abandon the idea. In that case, the bootstrapping was just free entertainment and practice at bootstrapping. Essentially I've entertained myself with imaginary impulse spending and practiced for the next real one.


**Bootstrapping:**

Starting a business doesn't take a lot of money. At least in the USA. I can't comment on other parts of the world, as I've never tried to start a business in another country.

My paddle business began with a ~$70 scroll saw I got from Amazon, the blade it came with, ~$10 worth of sand paper, ~$10 worth of polyurethane, and ~$20 worth of Patagonian Rosewood. It was impossible to buy only the wood to make one. So, ~$110 to make two paddles. My goal was small. To build a private collection of BDSM gear, fund it by selling the excess. One rosewood paddle went into my personal collection, one was sold for $60. The $60 was spent on more wood, and away we go.

CBD candy is similar. Find minimum equipment to start. Produce a small batch. See what happens. Maybe I just bought my wife candy equipment for no reason. Oh well, she loves creating desserts anyway, and it came from risk-less paddle money. Christmas came early for her. Maybe I created a smooth running money machine. Only one way to find out. If successful, I can start looking at improvements. More diversion, more buying, more entertainment, more money. If unsuccessful, move to the next idea. 


**Uneven productivity:** 

If you feel like working all night. Do it. You'll be happier and you'll have achieved something and given yourself breathing room for the inevitable down-turn in mood and energy. You future-proof yourself against your own disease.


**Superpower, with power to spare:**

"Anyone else experience mania without euphoria? Full disclosure, I was only diagnosed with Bipolar I at the start of this year.  I'm still learning and connecting the dots on a lot of things - what was a manic episode, what wasn't, when they started, when they ended, etc.  I grew up with a bipolar mom and sister so I might know slightly more than your average person, but I'm still mostly clueless.

I was diagnosed earlier this year in the middle of a mixed manic episode or manic episode with mixed features.  I even went to the hospital at one point during this due to fears I was going to hurt myself (fears that are not entirely unreasonable considering I have in the past).  This is the only episode I know about for sure, because I was diagnosed during it by a professional.  Everything else is still ""Was that an episode, or just a weird month for me?""

During this episode, I had zero sensation of euphoria, no feelings of grandeur, no hypersexuality, no compulsive spending, no blind optimism.  Just horrible, horrible agitation, paranoia, anxiety, anger, fear.  It was like being in fight or flight mode, but for hours, days, weeks.  I have panic attacks and I'm mostly used to them at this stage in my life, but during this period my panic attacks would last HOURS - like five or more.  Obsessive thoughts about death going about 500 miles a minute.  Caught in really bad thought loops of wanting to hurt myself.  Full body shaking, crying, terror at absolutely nothing, for hours.  

When *that* wasn't happening, I was just super irritable and angry and agitated.  Couldn't sit still, would go outside in the yard and pace for hours.  If anyone tried to talk to me, I'd be snippy and aggressive and demeaning for absolutely no reason.  I'm sure I was a terror to live with during this period of time.  I cut off a lot of my friendships with people over seemingly small transgressions (although most of them were assholes and I don't regret it lol).  Super confrontational and unable to remain quiet in situations where I'd normally just internalize my anger.  I was sleeping anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours a day at most, sometimes less, and only eating maybe once every three days or so.  This all lasted almost four weeks, although it was at it's worst during the first two or three. 

I'm just wondering, is it like this for anyone else?  I see a lot of people with BP (especially BP II) saying things about how much they enjoy mania, how it's fun at first, etc but mine genuinely didn't have any period where it was fun at all.  It was all fear, all paranoia, all anger.  No productiveness, no house cleaning, nothing like that - I was too fucked up to do anything besides lay down shaking or pace around for hours.

"Shifting sexual orientation/interest during a high? Uncertain about a friend's behaviour Hi all. I hope it's okay I post here. 

I (f) have a good friend (m) whom I've grown very close with over the past 2 years. He has bipolar disorder. We trust each other a lot, he's been incredibly loyal and supportive and we've shared very personal stuff I know neither of us opens up about easily or frequently. Usually I would say he behaves like an older brother. 

But during his recent (ongoing) high episode, I feel like he's become very romantic and flirtatious toward me, flattering, tongue in cheek, plays with words, uses pet names (he knows I'm ok with but doesn't normally use himself), makes sexual innuendos, wants to talk and hang out all the time. Not in such an intrusive way that would make me feel uncomfortable, it's just that if I didn't know he was gay and manic, I would be sure he was interested in me. I'm usually hopelessly oblivious of being flirted with, but knowing him closely, I notice that this is not typical of him. It is more typical of him flirting with other men.

I know that as a friend, starting anything with him is off the table even if he wanted to/regardless of his sexual orientation, and I know these things can all be symptoms of his episode. But now I'm also questioning that if I didn't meet him as an exclusively gay man, I might have been attracted to him. It's like his sexual energy is infectious. The best thing I was able to come up with was laughing or brushing it off, noting that he's being slick without rebutting, handling it as a funny/joking remark or saying something like ""you wouldn't be into that"". I haven't brought up that it's making me confused about my own feelings.

So I guess what I'm hoping to receive are some personal insights or experiences as a reminder and confirmation that this is due to his bipolar. Did something like this happen to you before? Am I judging and handling this correctly? What else do I do? I don't want to mess up our friendship and I'm afraid he'll think he's messed up and withdraw once his episode is over (which is sadly something he can be prone to).

I know I had behavioral issues severe enough to get me into treatment by 13 (although I didn't get the BP diagnosis until 24), and I know I *reported* hallucinations as young as 15 (but I don't remember when I first had them). I know as a child I had what in an adult would be classified as paranoid delusions--I used to think if I didn't draw stars in the fog inside my shower in a certain order, the water coming out of the showerhead would be replaced by ants--but in a 10 or 11 year old might just be normal? I know that by 16ish I knew--very privately and in a way I really tried to run from for a long time--that there was something wrong with me that I thought I should hide from people.

When did you all start to notice symptoms? Do you ever wonder about stuff from really early life?

EDIT: It's so odd that everyone who has commented before is placing onset some time between childhood and ~puberty. Same for me, but it makes me wonder why all the lit says symptom onset *starts* at 15 at the outside earliest except in very rare cases. Maybe it's just what tends to be reported as a start date of a definitely identifiable episode by the time you get to diagnosis (which is on average something like 25-30?)",bipolar

"Was my manic episode a result of drug abuse, being bipolar, or both? TLDR; confused about the nature of weed in relation to mania, and whether or not a diagnosis of bipolar disorder is warranted if a manic episode is preceded by drug abuse (much more context below) Hey y'all, was wondering if I could get some opinions on a thing.

I've suffered from mild to moderate depressive symptoms on and off since I was 18, two years ago I smoked a lot of weed over a few months and then suffered a psychotic break, and last year I experienced a manic episode after smoking a lot of weed, and have been suffering the same depressive symptoms since. I've smoked weed on and off since (it really helps me chill out sometimes) and have had no symptoms of mania or psychosis from said smoking.

Am I bipolar?

I should add that I'm trans (I came out a few months before I went fully manic) and had been dealing with a variety of issues and stresses before the manic episode, and that a doctor I saw afterwards diagnosed me as having dysthymia and gender dysphoria and suggested the cause of the episode to be purely drug oriented. However, through my own scouring of forums, blogs, articles, and journals, I don't think this can be said for certain, as there is considerable support to the opinion that regardless of the context of a manic episode, if you suffer one, you are bipolar.

If anyone has any thoughts or insights, they would be greatly appreciated :) and don't worry - I'm not expecting a definitive answer or anything. This is a topic that does not have adequate research and is remarkably complex. And obviously a professional is the only one capable of making any kind of diagnosis, but  I'm curious to know if others have shared a similar experience, and what others think in general.

But anyway, context: been depressed most of my life, recently diagnosed schizophrenic, 2 months ago I started changing, the last month have been pretty crazy, but I didn't notice it will 2 weeks ago when I talked to a friend and told me this is ""abnormal"" and told me to book an appointment, so I did, it was today, told my psychologist everything that happened the past 2 months, he drew basically the Depression Mania graph and told me I am slipping away upwards, he used the word ""high"" instead of mania, I guess for 2 reasons, he probably doesn't want to use it since I am not diagnosed bipolar and also he said ""you're not quite there yet"" which I assumed he meant I am not in a ""full blown mania"" yet, not sure if he just meant full blown mania or even not close to hypomania, but I guess it's serious enough for him to immediately call my psychiatrist and tell her to book an appointment and also talked to my parents (he asked if I want him to tell them or I will, I told him he should since I don't see what's wrong with me, I am happy and full of energy and productive after years of depression and that he might be able to explain to her why this is serious, without my own biased opinion on the situation getting in the way) and he said that they will either lower my dose or introduce another medication.....

Everyone is telling me I am being weird and slowly ""losing it"", and I hate it, because I feel great, I feel on top of the world and now they want to take that away from me, why? it doesn't hurt anyone, it doesn't hurt me, I feel amazing, I love this, yet they want to take it away, I don't want them to take it away, this is my first time feeling this way, I guess they don't want me to crash to depression but I honestly don't feel like I will ever get down back there again, it like as if it opened my eyes on a different way to live life, if I am feeling depressed it's not good ""take this"", if I am feeling amazing, alive, happy, energetic, I am being productive and doing something with my life it's not good ""take this"", and now I am just scared to tell them I don't want their medication and that they will start to bullshit something to get me commited into the hospital again ""he's clearly not rational enough right now to make a rational decision and because of that it will only make his disorder worsen therefor we recommed commiting *insert name* to the hospital to get treatment"" I know they will pull something like that, or use my disorder againts me ""he's manic and it flared up his delusions again and he refuses to take his medication because *insert excuse from the 101 option list here*"", I CAN'T HAVE THAT, I finally got my shit together, I started doing things for the sake of my future and I have plans and shit I don't want everything to be ruined because they are going to commit me to the hospital for who knows how long, it will ruine EVERYTHING!, I can't have that, but I also don't want to take my medication or the other medication they want to mix with my current one! everything I do is apperantly ""wrong"" and ""dangerous""...

"Being ""Stable"" is kind of boring. I feel like bipolar is the kind of the ultimate, damned if you do, damned if you don't.

Depression, obviously terrible, hypomania feels great but you can't trust your judgment and you can get very destructive and the mood swings are exhausting and stressful yet you also feel great/on top of the world and being ""neutral""/not cycling, being ""stable"" bores me and makes me long for hypomania. 

And maybe this is because I have been recently diagnosed, but during the ""stable"" period, it's kind of hard to relax because I feel like I am watching myself and behavior everyday to make sure I am not about to or at the beginning stages of cycling, especially since I am a type 2 that rapid cycles. I know I think more clearly when I am not cycling of course, and my life is so much better but I miss the high of hypomania, not all day but definitely at some point each day.

I am doing what I can to get things in my life in order, researching, reading, changing things because I want to do everything I can to tackle having bipolar disorder but damn, attempting to be your most emotionally healthy self feels like being in really responsible boring cage, at least right now.

"Did anyone else ever have loud rapid and repeating thoughts? Before I got diagnosed with BP 1, I had these really annoying rapid loud and repetitive thoughts that shot through my mind everyday almost 24/7 especially when I would try to sleep. It was involuntary and I couldn't control them no matter what. For example if someone said ""hey we should see that movie"" my brain would loudly say back ""movie..MovieMOVIEMOVIEMOVIEEEmoooovie mooooovieeee"" or it would be melodic sometimes like I'd think ""I don't know"" then the involuntary thoughts would be like ""I dooon't KnooOOoooOw🎶"" ""why don't iiii knooowww🎵"" but I remember it would happen mostly with just words and phrases/short sentences like ""I hate you, HateHAtehaate"" ""I love you looooove you"" but they were never truly audible, I never really heard them but they were just like the voice in your head like your conscious, so from when I was little up until my diagnoses (a year ago) I thought it was just my conscious being a little more.. weird than most but I thought everyone had that for 18 years I believed everyone's brain was doing this. I never thought to bring it up to anyone until my first bad manic episode came on and the rapid thinking and loud subconscious got louder and more violent and unhinged like ""Go die do die Godiegodiediedie"" ""CraaaaazyFUCKINGCRAZY"" ""Never make past 18, 18, 18....18181818"" ""staringatyoustaringatyouSTARINGATYOUstaringatyou....staaaaaaring.....at......youuuuuuuuu"" for people who never have experienced this I can only describe it as getting a song stuck in your head, you can't hear it but you can still hear the tune and the words in your head repetitively. After I got diagnosed I got put on some medication and the rapid thoughts and involuntary phrases and all that pretty much ceased and for the first time in my life I had peace in my head, and every time I think about it it actually makes me cry because it's like someone was inside you that you wanted out but couldn't get out and one day they were gone and occasionally when I'm hypomanic or nearing mania it comes back but it's much more dulled and I can tune it out more easily, has anyone else experienced this?",bipolar

"Spark Plug Little Girl With Dynamite Hands Some days I'm a bulletproof vest

But most I'm holding the rifle

Cracks hot target practice with the heart residing in my chest

Waking up with a bullseye that's still painted on my dress

Close your eyes, gentle finger trigger press
 
Other days my mouth is full of soot

Turned from gunpowder and flint.

The lights are on but the house is empty,

And my world is a sea of swimming grays

I have only a piece of a life vest that once was me

Holding my breath and counting the days

Until my tongue turns spark once more

Incinerating the cobwebs covering my bones

A spark plug little girl with dynamite stick hands

Unafraid of casted stones 

Capturing the sun in my throat

To burn bright my nights and cast light on my shadow REM
 
Cartwheel jumping jacks

Train of thought blown from its tracks

A nightmare carousel spinning dangerously on end

Practicing flexibility 

To see how far I can make my mind bend

1. You're not in love no matter how much you want to marry him after only getting to know him for a few days.

"Would this be possible? (hypotheticals) **If you're going to comment, please read the post in its entirety. I have semi-frequent experiences of not being properly understood or having people ask questions or make comments or remarks about things that are either in my post that they somehow ignored and forgot, or completely contradict my post in general**

In a nutshell, from what I've gathered being a regular visitor and my experiences here, bipolar disorder and treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (unipolar depression) have a lot of things in common.☆ Some, though I assume what would actually be a small minority, in the medical community think that unipolar depression and bipolar depression acually exist on the same or similar spectrum. Something like that. My point is that there are recognized similarities.

Taking this into consideration, *is there an existing feature of unipolar depression that parallels bipolar disorder in that there would be hypomanic symptoms or something strikingly similar present?* 

I think an important (but not my only) justification for my confusion and also curiosity: the existence of unipolar depression with mixed features. If it were possible, I imagine that ""unipolar hypomanic symptoms"" (I know don't laugh lol) would manifest in different ways.

"What to do when my psychiatrist isn't helping Right now my anxiety and depression is destroying my life. The depression isn't nearly as bad as it has been before, but the anxiety is controlling me. I never leave my house except for work, and most days I try to sleep until work starts (5pm) to avoid dealing with the anxiety. I am avoiding everything in my life, never answer my phone, never check my email, and avoiding everything related to college. Last week my power got shut off because my auto pay apparently cancelled 3 months ago so I didn't know I hadn't been paying, they had been trying to contact me the whole time. I took two summer classes and got too anxious to go, but was also too anxious to go in and drop them which has cost me $1800 for nothing. In addition, I needed those credits to maintain a scholarship so this will end up costing me about 15k during the rest of my time in school from losing my scholarship. I also remember my school trying to contact me when last semester ended about me owing around $1000 already. I heard the message but never called back. I don't talk to anyone outside of work and I constantly feel uncomfortable when I'm not at home. Yesterday in therapy my therapist helped me go through my email and I nearly had a panic attack even with her there, I started sweating and could barely breathe. The more I avoid things the worse they get and I feel helpless. I called my psych to tell him I can't function right now and all he did was tell me to get blood tests so he can possibly up my lamictal. I don't even go back for 2 more months. Can I go to my regular doctor or will she just tell me to go to a psychiatrist? Any help would be greatly appreciated. ",bipolar
"Telling Mom who is in denial about my disorders. I'm in the process of being diagnosed for Bipolar 2, since it takes a while I'm marked up with major depressive disorder currently. (I also am diagnosed with ptsd, add, anxiety, and depersonalization). I experience the ups and downs and I feel like it controls my life, I told my mom about it way before and told her how I thought that I may be Bipolar 2, she told me that I'm just depressed and that If I had it then she'd know and that it has to directly run in the family, she has depression and my dad has borderline personality disorder, no one past them talks about disorders in the family but I know there's probably a few. I just went with what she said, then I crashed pretty bad into a month long depressive episode and she didn't know what to do and almost called me into the hospital, only at that point did she think it was serious enough and got me evaluated last month. They put me on zoloft but it hasn't done much I don't think, had a fast paced manic episode the last 2 weeks and I feel like I'm crashing again. I constantly feel like I'm racing against a clock/battery and I recently talked to someone who has Bipolar 2 about it and I'm pretty sure I know myself. I just don't know how to tell my mom because I don't think she wants to accept it cause it's something she doesn't know how to deal with and she worries about me a lot.

My psychiatrist's on board with the whole 'this is bullshit' thing so we're appealing but who knows how long that'll take.  I feel so trapped and this is all because I was in hospital for 5 days.

"Is it ok to take topamax? ""Dopamax""? Whatsup everyone

First time poster here

Just diagnosed with Bipolar 1 about a month ago, one of the meds I was prescribed was topiramate - the generic for topamax. Anyway I take 150 mg twice a day and this nurse at the outpatient I'm I just started was talking to me about all the meds I'm on. She was telling me topamax can cause memory loss, it can make people have problems with math and people call it ""dopamax""? So of course I didn't think of this until after my meeting with her but can topamax or topiramate cause any permanent brain damage at all? What would happen if I was to just stop taking it cold turkey but I continued to take my other mood stabilizers? I know these are questions I need to ask a doctor but any help would really be appreciated. I was just diagnosed and this is all still really new to me.

Thanks.

Edit: It was the hospital who set me up with 150 mg, the nurse at the outpatient I just started thought that was really high. So I think she would be pretty open to at least weaning me off of it.",bipolar
"My mania is rarely ""happy"". Anyone else feel this way? I have a hard time recognizing my hypomania and I think it's because I considered ""elevated mood"" to equate happiness.  


I usually don't sleep much, forget to eat, and feel anxious in a weird way, and I feel a strange buzz?  
I also generally buy stupid shit even though I know I shouldn't. I recognize the purchases are a bad idea and then think, ""well it's fine because I'm not actually hypomanic!""


However, there have definitely been times where I binge drank during episodes, partied a lot, and acted way more promiscuous than usual.  
I know those times are textbook manic, and mostly everything I'm describing is. It's hard though because I have a difficult time gauging my hypomania since I am generally always some form of dysthemic. I always have a low-grade depression and my anxiety increases.

"Struggling with finding happiness after mania.. As I stabilize out on Lexapro after about 4 weeks, I'm finding myself with a bit of anhedonia. What's making it more difficult is coming to the realization that the only reason I had such unending optimism and energy over the summer and fall was because I was completely manic. 

I finally felt confident in all my decisions and was sure I was on the right path. The highs were great, but the lows were what made me consult a pdoc by the end of it all. 

I'm struggling to find that excitement and optimism now. I feel ""good"" but almost.. limited, maybe, to just how good I could feel. It seems hard to get excited about anything sometimes. 

Anybody got any success stories to share? Current meds are 450mg buproprion (Wellbutrin) and 10mg escitalopram (Lexapro). 100mg quetiapine (Seroquel) at night. Switched to Lexapro after trying Risperdal, Vraylar, Latuda, and Zyprexa. Zyprexa was amazing and made me feel what I think a normal person feels like, but the unending hunger and subsequent weight gain was too much for me. Lexapro has certainly helped stabilize my mood..

"Help, My Bipolar Disorder and Anxiety are affecting my relationship So bare with me here...new to Reddit and I'm looking for some words to help not more negativity. I've been dealing with my bipolar disorder and anxiety now since I was 15, I've tried meds after meds, I've done Therapy, but it just doesn't get any easier. I'm finally on some meds that I feel are doing great but I'm still not a hundred percent there. Example: last night I went into a fit of rage that ended in a huge panic attack because my boyfriend has some friends who just bought a house so they invited him and two of his buddies to come see it. Him being the thoughtful person he is, he obviously wants to include me in his plans, when he asked me to come with him I automatically felt sick to my stomach and said no. I've never met these people and the thought of meeting new people made my skin crawl and I felt so uncomfortable. So we got in this huge fight because I wouldn't ""try"" to meet them, and I got so mad at myself that I lost it and started yelling at him, he got defensive and yelled back because he thought I was mad at him (when really I was mad I couldn't do something as simple as meeting these people), and I ended up breaking down and just went into a full blown panic attack. My boyfriend is a social butterfly, everyone loves him and I've yet to meet anyone who doesn't, unfortunately for Him, I'm not. I hate being in crowds, I usually meet people and somehow either I must be saying or doing something wrong because they always end up hating me or thinking I'm too weird to be friends with. So I've just opted for seclusion. I have three friends who I never see anymore because they're all far from me now since I've recently moved in with my bf, so I don't have anyone familiar around me to hang out with anymore. So my bf has been pushing me to be friends with his friends so I'm not lonely, but I dont feel like I fit in and definitely don't feel like I belong whenever I'm around them. He tries to get me to engage but I just get uncomfortable and shut down. I feel really depressed and feel like I'm worthless for not being able to do basic human functions and I want to try but I just can't. I honestly feel like we just aren't meant for each other, I love him to death and I know he loves me but I just don't feel like I belong in his world. I feel like he's better off without me. I'm not sure what to do or how to deal with the depression I'm in, I keep taking my meds but I really want to go to this house warming thing next Friday but I just don't think I can do it. I'm terrified and if he goes I'll be home alone and I know I'm going to feel horrible the entire time I'm alone because I couldn't go. So if anyone has any advice....I just want to start somehow getting over this irrational fear...how do I talk to him about this? Should I just let him go alone and stay home and deal with the emotions...

I got prescribed 150mg of Seroquel, but it made me tired to the point where I was falling asleep at work, so I stopped taking it. My new psychiatrist said based on my symptoms, he thinks I have bipolar disorder, but he said that someone who really has bipolar disorder would not have been falling asleep at work after taking 150mg. I thought this was too broad for him to say because everyone has different body chemistry. Also, it seems like a lot of people on here get really tired from Seroquel, anyway, so it doesn't strike me as abnormal to have that kind of reaction to it.

"doctor won't fill my Seroquel Prescription. Am i going to be okay? I've had bipolar for years but only recently started taking medication in November. I take 25mg of Seroquel nightly, and 150 mg Wellbutrin twice daily (this was to help me quit smoking). My pharmacy contacted me on Wednesday telling me my prescription for Seroquel would not be filled unless they had authorization from my doctor's office. I called my doctor's office on Thursday, letting them know. The receptionist told me my doctor was on emergency leave, but she would get the authorization to the nurse practitioner. My pharmacy faxed them on Thursday and Friday, but never got anything back from them when I called them on Saturday to see when my prescription would be ready for pickup. I left a message for my doctor on Sunday and this afternoon but haven't heard back. 

As of yesterday, I'm out of Seroquel. I wasn't able to sleep last night and I feel extremely out of whack today. I know I probably sound like a hypochondriac, but if for some reason my doctor doesn't get back to me, am I going to be okay stopping the medication suddenly? Anyone have a similar experience?

"My depressive side winning arguments I bet ya'll had an argument with yourself debating wether you should or shouldn't do something (in this case going to class) and no matter how much you try and try to keep it cool and doing what is right but your depressive side is just too loud to ignore. It doesn't come with a valid reason or even facts it just says some bullshit like ""don't go"" or ocassionally will come with some lame ass excuse that is so stupid that you stop fighting it and get tired (because even though it doesn't say the right thing is consistent and persistent) and then you ultimately give in. But when you do so you do it quitely, turning the other way and possibly crying thinking to yourself ""this is not the right thing, how am I so weak to let myself do this?""

"Let's talk about irritability So I'll start if by saying that my husband is an maxing husband and father. But he drives me nuts!  

I have been finding myself so irritable towards him and only him. Anything he says or does pisses me off. 
He's been working on my vehicle and every time he fixes one thing another thing needs fixing. I've been without my vehicle for over a month. That's the main source of my anger but I turn into a monster when he tells me it's not ready to drive yet. 

I know this is not his fault. But it sets me off for the whole day.  Once I'm irritated once, every tiny little thing will turn me into someone I don't like.  And I take it out on mainly my husband.  

What can I do to not get so irate with him? I know coping skills and I use them daily but sometimes it's just not enough. Should I talk to the dr about this? For medication I'm on geadon, lamictal and neurotin.

"Question for those who have Bipolar II with dysphoric mania My boyfriend [m26] has bipolar II with dysphoric mania. I was reading that this form of bipolar is more difficult to medicate and treat. We *are* in the process of finding him a good psychiatrist, but I'm trying to gain knowledge in the meantime that could even be helpful during his visit. 


He's never had a good experience with medication in the past so he gave up and has been unmedicated most of his life. He's afraid of medication that would cause him to feel numb, fatigued, gain weight, or decrease his sex drive. He already has problems in these areas so exacerbating them seems counterproductive to increasing his quality of life if they could be avoided. 


I'm *not* looking for drug suggestions to replace what a professional has to say. I also know it's a trial and error process and that everyone is different. Just wondering if anyone out there that has this form of bipolar has received successful treatment, and are there any medications for this type that generally have minimal side effects? I realize the same thing doesn't work for everyone but I just want to hear from everyone's experiences with bipolar II with dysphoric mania. 


Also, any tips on ways I could help him when he's manic (having racing thoughts and being overly cynical/negative)? Anything that works for you? He said he literally doesn't know of anything I could do to help (because he's only been helping himself up until this point). Anything you wished your loved ones knew/understood about your bipolar? He's never had anyone to care about him or take him seriously, and I want to be the best I can for him because he's an amazing person. 


I have had depression and severe social anxiety most of my life as well as my PTSD being so bad at one point that I was completely disabled for over a year. I understand what it's like to feel like there's no hope and to be in constant suffering. I want to give him the support that he deserves. I had support and I got to a much better place and as long as he accepts the help I'm determined to get him to a better place too. ",bipolar
"I feel invalidated I've been having recurring depression that lasts for a couple weeks, then goes away for a bit, then comes back. Last weekend I happened to notice I was feeling really good, higher than usual. Previously I suspected I could be bipolar, but I wasn't sure because I didn't realize any hypomanic type phases. But last weekend it was like night and day. I was sure. I spent all weekend trying to figure it out and started realizing other times I felt this way. Apparently you don't always know when you're hypo, so that makes sense I guess.

So I'm having a great weekend, and once I had mostly come down so to speak, on Monday I think it was, I went in to try to get a psychiatrist. I was told they only offer group therapy, due to budget cuts and that I seemed in too good a state for me to really need to be there. I'm not a group person, so I denied that. They referred me to a family therapist at my clinic for an appointment late next month. I decided to email her and ask if she's the right type of therapist to help me figure this out, she told me she could make a diagnosis, but it would be better for me to see a psychiatrist.

So I asked my primary if we had any psychiatrists in town, and she told me we don't. I'd need to drive 100 miles to a larger town. I'm been having car problems lately so I was not happy about this. By then it was Wednesday and I was feeling less great by each day, and hearing this really got me down a level. Luckily I did have plans to get together with some friends (who happen to be bipolar). We had a nice time, but they mentioned sexual assault and were talking about that a bit, and I got to thinking..

I eventually went home as I have to get up early for work the next morning. And as I'm laying in bed trying to fall asleep, I start to think about my various past sexual experiences and if any of those had been assault.
I started looking up sexual assault and it's basically just when you haven't given someone consent. I had an experience last year where I was alone, working, at night, in a liquor store and a drunk customer was giving me grief. He wanted to kiss me, on the lips no less, and I wasn't okay with that, I told him no but he wouldn't take it, and he came in at me and kissed me. I felt frozen, like I couldn't stop him and I had no one around to help, so I let it happen. Eventually he left. I never told anyone because I thought it wasn't that bad. It's just a kiss. What's the big deal?

So as I was saying, here I am Wednesday night, looking back on this and realizing that is sexual assault. And that was such a terrible feeling to look at it in that way. I couldn't handle it. I went out into the living room to tell my boyfriend, that he made me feel like I was in the wrong and how I felt during the experience, and that I now see it for what it was. I did some crying, he consoled me, all better right? No. I went back into my room, laid down and proceeded to ugly cry. When I ugly cry, I tend to end up relieving it with cutting. So I did that and felt a little better, but I was still in that well of despair and I knew I shouldn't be alone in my room, with sharp objects. So I got some clothes on and got my shoes on (as my boyfriend looks at me worried, I kissed him and told him to leave the door unlocked) and I left, taking nothing with me.

I ended up going out without a purpose or direction in mind specifically, but subconsciously (and because I don't go for walks without a destination), I was headed back to my friend's place. This took maybe 1.5 hours and by that time, no one was awake. At this point it was pretty late, I was very tired and would need to be up for work in about 2 hours, maybe 3 if i stretched it. I don't function well with less than 4 or 5, so I probably wasn't planning on going to work the next morning.

I stood at my friend place for a few, then decided to start the trek back home. I was hoping I'd either be picked up by the police and they could help me or I'd die. I decided to take the route home that has the train tracks and as I was at those tracks, I spend a minute or so, standing there, thinking that if a train came, I could just let it all go, but I continued walking. As I was going around the bend and was on higher ground than the tacks, the crossing signs went down, the lights came on, and I heard the train coming. I really did consider going back down there. I had the time, I could have, and I'm a very impulsive person... but I didn't I continued walking, watched the train pass, decided it didn't seem like it was going very fast and wondered how fast it was going and if it could have ended me. I continued walking, got home, tried to eat something, and crashed. By then it had been about 3 hours since I had left.

I woke up an hour or two later when my boyfriend kissed me on my forehead and said goodbye. I moved into the bedroom and slept maybe an hour or two more at most. When I woke up again I still wasn't feeling ready to get out of bed, so I was talking to my friends I was with the night before and told them what happened. They strongly suggested I tell my doctor. So I sent my doctor an email and at this time my phone was on silent. I was going to try to get back to sleep. Apparently she emailed me back 20 min later, I didn't answer. She called, I didn't answer. And the next thing I know, there were police at my door.

I was completely out of it and complied with all their orders. They took me to the place where I was previously on Monday. I talked to the same lady I talked to on Monday and she noticed a distinct difference in how I was acting. She asked me if I wanted to be taken to the state hospital or the CRU (apparently I picked wrong). I decided to go to the state hospital. An officer took me over, I was admitted and held for approx 26 hours. During that time, I mostly slept, specially the first day. During that first day I saw a psychiatrist and after talking with me and assessing me, he neither gave me a diagnosis or any medication. He said he is generally against medication. He tried to suggest I should be eating organic, drinking spring water and practicing mindfulness and other techniques. He also tried to get me to believe suicide is not the answer and told me to watch videos on youtube about people coming back from suicide and seeing the light. (I'm atheist if that matters).

I was upset with the way he handled it all and I'll admit, my motto is ""I'll survive"" as in I've been through a lot of tough times in my life and I've made attempts before, and I've been depressed for far longer than the attempts I've made, so yes, I am powering through, I'm a survivor, it's what I do.... BUT

I'm impulsive and do having feelings of depression and wanting to hurt myself. When I mention depression, he tells me it's all in my head and it's no excuse and I can overcome it. But like I said, I cooperated. He said he wanted to release me that night... maybe 8-10 hours I had been there... but he usually doesn't do that and didn't want to risk anything, so he said he'd release me the next morning, if I signed a voluntary admission form. So I did and was released at 1pm.

I get home and was finally able to talk to my boyfriend (his phone hasn't had service recently) and I find out he looked for me. He went to the regular hospital, then the state hospital (he knew I was at a hospital), and the state hospital has a lot of buildings, so he's checking all these buildings, no one seems to be helping him find me. He finally checks the building I'm in.. and the lady flips through a book monetarily, says she can't give out information, so he leaves. This pisses me off because I specifically added him to my shared information list. This does not give me a good vibe of the state hospital at all.

Before I left, they made sure I had an appointment for a therapist, which is the appointment I previously made for next month. So now I'm home, I'm safe, I'm with my friend (and getting together with another friend as well tomorrow). I have a good support network and I think I'll get through this. I talked to my mom tonight and she doesn't believe I'm bipolar of course, but I understand that's normal of mothers.

Now I'm just waiting for this appointment, to try to figure out why I'm feeling this way, what if anything is making me feel this way and how to solve it. I'm not really looking for anything specific from any of you. I'm just venting and want to maybe get some perspectives from any of you. Obviously a diagnosis will be handled by my therapist, but until then, I could use some support. Thanks!",bipolar
"Hairdresser comments ""one of them"" about bipolar disorder I got my hair cut today, and I overheard a nearby hairdresser talking to her client about how the family doctor thinks her son might be bipolar. She repeatedly denies that her son is bipolar, which seems fair. However, then she goes ""my friend's ex husband was one of them."" She proceeds to discuss bipolar with her client. I felt like she was talking about people with bipolar disorder as if we're aliens or something. I'm sort of laughing about this, nervously, but feel indirectly outcasted/misunderstood/discouraged.

"Paranoia I don't know where to turn but I'm having quite intense paranoia at the moment. It's usually when I'm in bed falling asleep or waking up, and I will wake up in the middle of the night frantic. 

I have this feeling that I haven't put some security on my phone so everyone has access to everything and people are using it to spy on me. It's also a password that I was meant use on certain applications but haven't so now I have let a whole bunch of people down.

It's really unclear what it is, in the moment I will always work it out so it feel like it makes sense but the next day when I reflect on it I can't grasp it. This makes it quite distressing because it then feels like I'm forgetting something really important which I need to do.

I will tear through my room in the middle of the night looking for a device that people have planted. I've been so close to messaging my bf in the middle of the night to interrogate him, but I stop myself.

"Quickly losing faith in my health care I saw my new psychiatrist for the first time last Wednesday. He's a private psychiatrist working between two locations (2-3 hours apart), and he's only at the office where I see him on Wednesdays and Thursdays. He wanted to put me on Abilify, but for me to also stop Effexor cold turkey after being on it for 3 years and never successfully weaning off. I guess that was the first thing that kind of stood out to me in terms of not being heard.

I went to the pharmacy on Saturday to get my Abilify prescription filled and the pharmacist said that it didn't specify how long the prescription was for, so she said she would fax him and ask about it. I realized it was going to take a while at this point because who the fuck faxes anymore? The pharmacist also gave me four days of Abilify and told me I could start my treatment on Saturday and then come back for the rest of my pills once this is resolved.

I had such little faith in it actually being resolved, that I asked about the withdrawal symptoms of Abilify if I were to stop suddenly after taking it for four days. The pharmacist was pretty dismissive and said it would be negligible.

On Tuesday afternoon, I still hadn't heard back from the pharmacy and I was on my last pill. I called and they told me to call my psychiatrist's office because they were more likely to actually get back to me. I loved how disillusioned the people at the pharmacy were. I called the office and the receptionist told me my pdoc wouldn't be in until Wednesday, but that she had left a note on top of his files so it was the first thing he would see in the morning and it would be resolved. Other than some pretty intense withdrawal creeping on from stopping Effexor cold turkey, I was still feeling alright.

Yesterday I waited until about 3, to give the man time to do anything he needed to. I didn't want to rush him. I called the pharmacy at 3 and they still hadn't received a reply. So I called the office again, and a different receptionist was working. I explained the situation and she told me she would look for my files and call me back.

An hour and a half later, still no call. I called again and she told me she couldn't find my files. Maybe the receptionist from the day before misplaced them? At this point it was 5 and the office was about the close. I explained the situation because she clearly brushed me aside the first time and didn't understand how important this was to me. The receptionist told me there was nothing she could do because my pdoc had already left the office for the day.

At this point I started bawling my eyes out on the phone, talking about how I just needed help and I'd been waiting almost a week for my new medication. Not my proudest moment but I was beyond frustrated. She responded with, ""Miss, I don't want you to cry. I need you to stop crying."" To which I replied, probably a little too loud, ""I just need a little compassion here. It's so hard to care about myself and getting better when it feels like the people who are responsible for my health care don't even think twice about me.""

I guess that outburst made her understand, and she said she would try to get a hold of him. I received a call from a private number a few minutes later, and it was my pdoc himself. He could tell I was still bawling on the phone, and I basically told him everything I told the receptionist. That this is a shit show and it just sucks. He told me he didn't have my files on his desk that morning, so he never saw the fax. Fucking fantastic. He told me that he would fix this. That he would call the pharmacy and sort things out for me, and then call me back. He never called back. 

I just went to sleep last night because I was sure the pharmacy would have called at this point if it had been resolved. I woke up early this morning and called, and it still had not been resolved. I feel so defeated. 

Currently experiencing withdrawal from the two drugs that I've experienced the worst withdrawal symptoms from. Abilify withdrawal makes me suicidal, and Effexor.. Well, if you've never had the pleasure of that withdrawal, I'm grateful. I can't stop crying and I don't know what to do anymore. Maybe it'll be resolved today, but will I ever trust these people again? Is it because I suffer from an invisible illness that I'm not taken seriously? Or is it because I'm a woman? Or a person of colour? It's hard not to feel like this is personal, even after looking at all the mistakes and negligence that led to this.

Please, if you were able to get through this wall of text, am I being ridiculous? Am I wrong for expecting more from the people who are forcing me to stay alive with the promise of it getting better?

Edit: Thank you all for your comments. They were what pulled me back from the edge when I felt like I was going to break. The meds are resolved, and I'm going to try and talk this out with my pdoc to gauge if we're still a good fit. ",bipolar

"Flashbacks/Intrusive thoughts Background: I've had BPD/bipolar II since I was 9 or 10 years old, but only started therapy last summer (at 25). I had a devastating mixed-episode breakdown in September - early October that left me hospitalized and actively suicidal, and was the culmination of several years' trauma and self-neglect.

Since then, I've figured out medication, resumed regular therapy, gotten a great job, and more or less stabilized. I reconnected with my partner, fell in love with what I do professionally and my team at work, started mending my family relationships, and have generally felt good about myself. I can't overstate how well-functioning Current-Me is compared to Recently-Past-Me.

But what's been terrifying lately, is that I've had more and more vivid flashbacks and lucid dreams that drag me back into spirals I've gone down anytime in the past 5-6 years. I've been blindsided by a smell, word/phrase, or even texture (on a fabric or a certain food) that triggers a flight into what I think is probably c-ptsd.

I've also had a huge uptick in intrusive thoughts. Over the last few weeks, I seem to have lost my ability to mindfully shut them down or hear them without verbalizing.

My best guess at what's going on is an analogy to what usually triggers migraines for me - I'm responding to some delayed ""release of stress."" But does anyone have a better explanation?

"Low dose abilify and hypomania? I posted about this [previously](

Now taking 1.25mg (roughly) of Abilify instead of 2.5mg and still experiencing some mild hypomanic symptoms. At first I thought I genuinely felt a lot better. But once I started having issues with sleep (mainly waking up and not being able to go back to sleep) I began to notice some very mild hypomania rearing its head. This is cause for concern for me as hypomania is kind of the persistent issue. And problems with sleep are a warning sign where I know something's wrong.

The weird thing is that the Abilify legitimately has brought me ""up"" quite a bit. I feel a little better and it's definitely energizing. Though too energizing in terms of restlessness and the sleep problems. This combined with the mild hypomania makes me think that the Abilify isn't going to work.

"I'm 99% certain I have Bipolar II, and I'm overwhelmed. Hey r/bipolar. 

I've always considered myself a pretty brilliant/talented person. Back in high school, my peers would often put me on a pedestal for a multitude of reasons - my writing skills, maturity, witty sense of humor, self-confidence, hyper-awareness (and resulting adaptability) to social situations, etcetera etcetera. I thought all people generally had similar thought processes as I did - one idea to the next, very rapid/excited pace of thinking, deep analytical interest/speculation for their surroundings, etc. Later I found out that, within the peers that I knew, it was just me.

Friends would often be jealous of my ability to excel at anything I *really* wanted to do. What would always rub me the wrong way, though, was when they'd tell me things like, ""I wish I was you"" or ""you don't know how lucky you are"". They didn't know that, due to my inability to truly relate to others, I've felt very, very alone for as long as I could remember. Extreme loneliness was a contributor to my suicidal thoughts, and formal diagnosis of depression, by both my pediatrician and my therapist. (I was also diagnosed with anxiety, but that was mostly because I was never happy back home from the lack of general open-mindedness in my community. I've moved now and met people whose company I've enjoyed much better.)

But after moving, I got depressed again, but for reasons I couldn't explain. Recently, when I was doing research on depression symptoms again (reading them has always made me feel more in control), at the very bottom of the list, it suggested additional research for Bipolar disorder.

Now, I had heard of bipolar disorder, but mostly in the context of Charlie Sheen having it in 2013. I never considered myself as someone who could possibly have it. But just for curiosity's sake, I read the symptoms, and they matched up with mine almost perfectly.

Initially, I was shocked, but thinking about it now, it makes complete sense. I met with an artist in May, and as we were speaking, we found out we shared certain traits - like how our minds felt like they were ""traveling at high speeds"" very often, and how confusing it was to us that most other people couldn't relate. At first, I just thought to myself, ""Hm, I guess we both might be special."" But later he told me he had bipolar disorder. At the time, I never made the connection that I could've had it also.

And even the roommate I get along with so well now - after I told her I might've had bipolar disorder II, she wasn't surprised, and just nodded, reminding me that she *also* had bipolar disorder (she told me a while back but I forgot). She agreed that she saw symptoms of bipolar II in me, as well.

The icing on the cake? I'm pretty sure my own *mother* is bipolar, but she never got diagnosed for it because she's against therapy. Growing up, I was always adjusting to her great ""highs and lows"" of extreme cheeriness, exaggerated self-confidence, and annoying levels of sunshine positivity, to terribly immature impulsiveness, moodiness, lashing out, and so on - which, I can confidently assume were hypomanic episodes. This would confirm the high likelihood that I'm bipolar through genetics, not to mention I just turned 19 recently, and the late teens are usually when biopolar symptoms ""develop"", apparently.

So I just don't know what to do from here. It's not like I can tell my mother (she would react *awfully*, as she is always in complete denial of mental health issues and would shame me for even bringing it up) nor have the money/resources to pay for treatment/therapy. I'm usually totally accepting about the knowledge that I have bipolar II, but only when I'm using it to my advantage, of course (like the ""insanely creative/productive"" phases). Sometimes, though, I admit that I feel like I'm losing my mind from the racing thoughts spiraling downward. 

I also hate ""feeling crazy"" - which, to a degree, I've always sort of felt, but not in a scary ""wow, I'm seeing the terrible effects of an actual bipolar disorder"" kind of way. I guess the word ""bipolar"" is still pretty scary to me, especially from reading all of those outlandish, grossly misinformed articles of bipolar celebrities as I was growing up. It makes me sad thinking I might have something I have trouble controlling, because it's a mental illness, and that it's something I would have to explain to every future close person in my life who has no knowledge of bipolar disorders.

There's also just so much information that I have trouble consuming it all. I get disheartened and tired of reading about ""what's wrong with me"" so sometimes I need to take a break from reading. Not to mention that I now think things like, ""Is this me, or is this my bipolar disorder?"" I just feel a bit afraid, lost, and overwhelmed. I don't know where I was going with this, but I needed to get it off my chest. Thank you for reading - any advice will help, as I've only started research on bipolar disorder last month. Coping methods? Health tips? Things to know? Vocab lesson? Guidance of any kind?

And, as a side note, I know I'll get through this. There are a lot of amazing traits to me that I'm grateful to have. I'm also the best when I'm consciously focusing myself on productive/interesting projects, and keeping myself busy. It's just when I go off-track, that things can start going bad for me. 

**TL;DR** Read all the symptoms for bipolar II and they match up with me almost perfectly. Conversations with other bipolar people, as well as being pretty certain that my mom is bipolar, have ""confirmed"" it for me. Overwhelmed, and could use a ""Dummy's Guidebook to Handling Bipolar II"".",bipolar

"I'm a couple days into a self-induced manic episode and deeply regretting it... So I was sober for 6m and recently I relapsed it was  devastating.

"Disclosing Bipolar in social media Hi everyone!

I have Bipolar 2. Diagnosed 3 years ago. Recently I have been feeling frustrated at how little others know about Bipolar and the stigma it carries. I go to support groups and have my parents sister and some good friends to talk to when I need to and I feel lucky. But they have and can't always be there for various reasons. It made me think of those who don't count with this support. I know I've felt many times like an outsider and misunderstood and judged. I've seen some friends open up about having depression and stuff on Facebook and I honestly want to do the same. I want to openly tell people about it to hopefully help take that stigma down and inspire others. I have learned to not let Bipolar define me or stop me. I go to college and I keep a pretty good GPA (engineering student!) I've gotten more than 5 internships under my belt and I have succeeded greatly at them (not trying to show off here, just want to bring it up because it's been hard work but it can be done). 

I guess my question is, have you guys ever done this? I have co workers close friends and random people I've met I. School on my social media. I understand not everyone will get it, but what would be the best way to come out about it ? Also, anyone recommend some Instagram accounts, blogs or anything like that of young people living with Bipolar ? 

Thank you all!!",bipolar
"trying to understand girlfriend with BPD and eating disorder *I want to preface this by saying she's not taking medication. We have great insurance but I can't seem to get her an appointment scheduled because everyone I call insists that she has to call on her own. She's totally on board with seeing a psychiatrist but struggles to stay motivated due to the nature of the process. Anyways...*


My girlfriend, of nearly one year, has been diagnosed with Borderline and BPD since she was roughly 14 years old. Her biggest struggle being her eating disorder. From what I've gathered, her piece of shit teacher damaged her in a way that is seemingly irreparable. I've found this subreddit specifically because I believe her BPD is what prevents her from being able to beat the eating disorder. She's been doing great with it since we began dating. Until recently. She hasn't lost an extreme amount of weight. She's explicitly stated that she's been struggling immensely. A couple nights ago she was very short and tempered with me and she later said it's because she was angry because she was eating. Things have since been getting worse and worse. She's very short tempered to the point that something as simple as dishes can evoke a full fledged civil war. This is not how she would have handled the situation 2 months ago.


So she's very obviously disgusted with men. I feel like she and I work thus far because I make a huge effort not to objectify women. She's said that she likes being skinny because no one cat calls her nor makes advances. Which has been happening a lot lately at work. I feel like this has been slowly triggering her more and more. However, she currently sees herself as being fat and truly believes it despite being fairly thin. What I absolutely cannot wrap my head around is the fact that most of the time she is very sexual, more than me. But, on the other hand, she wants to be 80 pounds again because she hates the way other men see her? It doesn't make sense. The only direction I see this going is it gets so bad she ends up in rehab again, comes back anew, then repeats. Even when she's happy, I have never heard her speak a single positive word about her weight. 

My question for you all is, would taking medication help her accept her weight?

 When she becomes upset, there is nothing I can do aside from waiting until she sleeps on it. Would medication help in these situations?

*I've been at my keyboard the past 4 hours trying to summarize this as best as I can, so I apologize for any inconsistencies. I just want to understand what's going through her mind.*",bipolar

Red Bull wore off and I was back to obsessively thinking about suicide and just laid on the sofa.

I was too afraid to walk my dog in the yard or even get off the sofa cuz I kept seeing it in my head and it was very graphic and realistic.

I start putting people down, get easily annoyd i start to think im better then others and i get into fights easily.

"Which doctor should i listen to? This is mostly just a rant because I'm angry and confused, I am not asking for medical advice, but I would appreciate advice (especially if you've been in a similar situation).

I just moved, so I had to find a new primary care doc and psychiatrist. I saw the primary care doc on wednesday, and it turns out he has a ton of experience with phsych med management. So I tell him about how I want to get off seroquel, and that the last psych I saw (as well as 2 psychs I saw at the hospital when i spent a week there) all said that after I'd been stable for a while that I could try and get off seroquel and possibly add a anti-depressant (I take lamictal, so this wouldn't be an anti-depressant on its own). They all said that welbutrin would be a good one to start with, since it would also help with my adhd. Fast forward ~6 months of stability and I want to give it a try. Primary doc says let's try it and keep a close watch on how things go. I started taking 150mg welbutrin xl yesterday. Today I had more energy than I've had in a long time, I would consider it an appropriate amount of energy for an adult leading a pretty low stress life.

Today I saw the psychiatrist for the first time, he agrees with my previous diagnosis of bipolar ii and adhd. So I tell him that I'd like to get off the seroquel, and that I'd discussed this with my previous pysch (who I saw for 1 1/2 years and trust completely) and that we had talked about replacing it with welbutrin. He agrees that I can go down on the seroquel, and to see if the lamictal solo works. I'm cool with all this, but then he tells me that he would never give a bipolar patient an anti-depressant even along with a mood stabilizer, and that he only ever uses anti-psychotics for depression in bp patients. That he would give adderall before welbutrin to a bp patient with adhd. It's entirely possible that I'm only angry with him because he doesn't agree with what I want to do, but I'm pretty confident that my anger stems from the fact that he isn't taking my input into consideration while coming up with a treatment plan. 

I don't have a huge problem with trying lamictal solo, but if I do start getting depressed I DO NOT want to be put back on an anti-psychotic. Seroquel made me constantly tired/sluggish, gain 25lbs, and I had uncontrollable cravings for sweets. Abilify sent me to the hospital because of akathesia...I don't want to touch another ap unless I'm getting hypo, and then only use it short term if possible.  

I don't know what to do. Do I continue to take the welbutrin? Do I try and get a 3rd opinion, which could take months? Do I stop the welbutrin and just continue to taper down the seroquel?

TL;DR Mostly just a rant, but also would appreciate some advice. Both docs agree I can try to get off seroquel. One doc says let's try welbutrin xl + lamictal combo, other says he would give a bipolar patient adderall before an antidepressant and should just try lamictal solo. Who should I listen to?",bipolar

"I don't know how to respond Okay, I don't know if anyone will even be able to help me but I need to ask somewhere so here goes.

I have bipolar 1, my mother also has bipolar but Im not sure which type. I was diagnosed at 17 (almost 12 years ago now) and got little support from my parents. I got the stereotypical advice of I need to get over it, I need to act happy, I need to just get out more and work out and eat healthy and I'll feel better. My mother was diagnosed a few years ago, and all of a sudden I'm expected to bend over backwards for her by my parents to make her feel better. On top of this she's an alcoholic, I understand that addiction is something difficult to get over but there's only so much I can take.

So, onto the issue at hand. My mother's alcoholism has taken it's toll on her pancreas in recent years. The cycle is basically, her pancreas becomes inflammed causing a significant amount of pain where she gets admitted to hospital for about a week and weened off of alcohol by the doctors and nurses. She turns over a new leaf and stops drinking, but after awhile starts to drink again while trying to hide it from everyone. We all notice and at the request of my father turn a blind eye to try and keep the family together. Things continue to escalate to the point where she's always drunk when we come over and I don't want her around my children. Then her pancreas becomes inflammed again and the cycle starts over.

This cycle has happened 3 or 4 times now in the past few years. Every time I've dropped everything and gone home and tried to be supportive. The last time I was pretty much done with it, it's a lot of negativity and stress which I've found to be detrimental to my own mental health. This time when my father texted me to tell me he brought her back to the hospital all I said was ""ok"". I have no more energy to expend on this. I don't like my mother, I never have, maybe it's heartless but do I need to? She's driven both my sister and I away with her constant drinking and confrontations, I don't feel comfortable with her around my kids, she makes me SO uncomfortable, and I don't think she wants to get better. She abused both my sister and I in our childhoods, she neglected us, and she was the one who dismissed me the most when I started having to deal with my own mental illness. I'm done, so my answer is ""ok"". This morning I got an update from my father, which basically ended with ""thanks for asking"" which I know is him trying to make me feel guilty for not really caring that my own mother is in the hospital.

Am I in the wrong? Am I being heartless? I don't know, all I know is I just really am indifferent to whatever happens to my mother at the moment.I am tired of caring about someone who doesn't even care about themselves or anyone around them.",bipolar
"What have you found to be the most manageable jobs to have? In terms of getting along with coworkers, the level of contact with people, flexibility with hours, etc.

The majority of my jobs have been working with people, which has always driven my anxiety up super high. I find ways to manage, but when I go into a mixed episode I end up having a lot of problems with forgetting things, working too fast but not getting everything done, and with people basically telling me I'm coming off as rude even though that's not my intention at all. These have mainly been  when I've worked in the service industry, and I've learned that I'm really not cut out for that field.

Right now I work at a treatment center for eating disorders, which I enjoy and it has gone well for the past almost 2 years. But I am having a mild mixed episode right now (I'm on medication and in therapy) and am becoming concerned about similar things from the past happening even though I am doing my best to manage.

"My bipolar disorder - A major Test of Patience I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about 13 years ago, but only accepted proper treatment about 11.5 years ago. These 11.5 years have been an extreme test of my patience. Patience in becoming stable (countless times). Patience with medications (working, side effects, withdrawals). Patience with coping with anxiety. Patience with finding the right mental healthcare providers. And the list could go on. But the worst has been the patience I've had to have in my quest to become fully functional again. I've been on some sort of disability for the majority of these 11.5 years. I try to be optimistic that I'll finally ""get there"" and be able to ""stay there"" long-term, but I wonder if it would be better to just accept where I am, while not exactly giving up.

I don't want to scare anyone with this post. Of course most people don't have such a challenging course. I do want to say that as frustrating and painful as it has all been, I'm happy I've been patient, despite some of the worst of times.

"How to avoid inpatient in this situation (suicidal thoughts) Hi everyone. In the past few days I've had this sudden, severe onset of what feels like depression (no energy, crying a lot, thinking about hurting myself, planning suicide). It's really overwhelming. I'm able to get an appointment in with a therapist in 2 days, but I think I might need a medication adjustment. I don't see a psychiatrist until October, and just getting that appointment scheduled was a giant headache since they're always so full. I am having these really upsetting thoughts about hurting myself, but I don't want to do it. I know this is just my illness and that it's going to go away eventually. I just really worry that if I presented to an ER looking for help that I'd get sent to inpatient (which has happened before in similar situations). I can't miss work because I need to pay bills, so inpatient really isn't an option for me.  The therapist I'm seeing this week is also kind of bad at dealing with bipolar issues (her specialty is like … trauma and hypnotism), and I don't know how to approach this with her without her freaking out and compelling me to go to the hospital (which has also happened before, when I wasn't even suicidal and when I was later told by the ER social worker that I was just fine. Ugh). Idk, I'm really worried here, and I feel really stuck in this situation. Ranting about this is kind of relieving, actually.

"Alcohol Replacement? Hello! I have Bipolar II and stopped drinking 3 years ago at the bequest of my psychiatrist as it greatly effects my mood and depression. My mood has improved, however, I have pretty bad social anxiety so it's very difficult to go out , enjoy myself and connect with other humans as most people drink to make that whole situation easier... Which in a way is making me super depressed since I'm a social creature and like having fun and making dumb mistakes in a group setting!

My psychiatrist and I are trying to brainstorm a solution - has anyone discovered a substance, supplement or practice that can help simulate some of the good effects of alcohol without the downside of depression and mood fluctuations? I tried coping with caffeine in the form of energy drinks, but this often lead to depression and the worsening of my anxiety.

"""psychiatry is not science"" (rant) I censor myself from FB usually, as in, I friend people but unfollow them, that way my feed is short and just full of articles from the Onion, events, and a couple best friends. But sometimes shit shows up anyway.


I recently friended someone so FB flooded me with all their ""likes"" and the first thing I see is a pic of someone carrying a sign at the science march. I think ""oh cool"" and click on it.


Sign says ""psychiatry is not science"" held by a smiling person, surrounded by other smiling people. Tons of congratulations in the comments. One person comments negatively and immediately is given long lectures by other people about how evil and fake psychiatry is. 


Now believe me, I have some psychiatry horror stories, including a really bad malpractice one that has shocked my other doctors and the psychiatrist should not be in practice. 


I have lived med-free for long periods of my life and general have a healthy diet/exercise/friend balance. I high-level function right now. But, without meds? I am a mentally ill person. Despite all these good habits, without meds, I will function ok a short period of time but I have always lost my jobs, relationships, money and home, over and over. I have abused drugs and been on the edge of suicide, and I do believe it's highly likely I will commit suicide in the future without proper meds. Other family members in the far past who were bipolar, without proper meds, committed suicide.


I can't believe this attitude is considered acceptable and something to smile about at a science march. It's actually eugenics to me. They're literally saying it's inconvenient for them that mentally ill people are visible and seeking treatment instead of just in asylums or committing suicide the way we did in the good ol days. Of course treatment can be a very rough journey and not always work. Of course, it can be really, really bad. But I cannot believe the ignorance of people who are like this. It's sickening to know they'd rather see me dead, or jobless/homeless but idk, drinking some herbal tea in the sun or whatever. Anyone who isn't part of their ""natural"" lifestyle narrative, they just ignore, would rather we didn't exist.


I hate being ""triggered"" but it still sucks to see how many mutual friends this person has with me and now I think less of quite a few people, like they aren't in the ""safe group"" of friends I can be honest with, or that they've judged me.


Perhaps I'm being over sensitive, it just disappoints and upsets me that someone would go to a science march of all places with this agenda and that people think it's okay.",bipolar
"I think its good for me to share this From the age of 16 through 19 I was being given antipsychotics in astronomical amounts. I don't remember much from this time. It was just miserable. I was neither psychotic nor violent, and my psychiatrist manipulated me into thinking this amount of medication was for my own good. All my subsequent doctors agree that I was not in good hands at all during this time.

One day when I was about 17 I had the strongest gut feeling that I needed to get off the medication and that the medication was the reason I was so miserable. I was inpatient and stopped taking the medication for about a week. I got sick and threw up the whole week (which kind of indicates the amount of medication I was given). At the end of the week I felt like myself again for the first time in years. I could feel things, and I could finally feel good feelings. I looked physically ill after throwing up all week, but I felt great. I was told I had to restart taking the medication or be locked inside the unit. I began taking the medication again. I was miserable until I quit once again, for good at 19. Shortly after I experienced my first manic episode.

Im 23 now. I've been manic and depressed a couple of times since. I've been taking a low dose of valium for my anxiety since I was 19 and about 14 days ago I took my last dose. 

I thought I was passed those experiences I had from 16 through 19. I never really thought about them these last years. I've never felt traumatized by them. I never look back or care anymore. I just moved on happy that I could feel feelings again.

"Hyper-religiosity (but I'm an atheist!) - A Ramble Throughout my life, I've had a number of bouts of hyper religiosity. Catholicism, Wicca and Fundamentalist Christianity at varying intervals. For probably the last decade, I have considered myself atheist. I attend a Unitarian Universalist church, which is pretty secular humanist, so I can comfortably be an out-of-the-closet atheist and still have the community of a church. 

All of that said, I've been experiencing the urge for hyper-religiosity (hyper-spiritualism? Existentialism?) for the last few weeks. The other day I even tried to go to a Catholic Church mid-week just to, I don't know what, just kneel in the quiet? It was closed, so I didn't go in. Then I heard about a Swami who was going to do a thing at our church this coming month, who is a follower of Amma (the hugging saint) and I felt this utter compulsion to go (I can't now, something else came up). 

I don't know what to do with all of this. I'm in a major depression (last 2-3 weeks) but I tend to have mixed episodes. I have this desperate desire to just have something, something I can't articulate,

"Needing support with/for Bi-Polar Girlfriend My girlfriend has been suffering from manic bi-polar disorder and depression since we first met a couple years ago. I've seen her at every stage of her mental illness. I've seen her at both hypo and hyper-mania. I've seen her self-harm and partake in really dangerous activities. 

Yesterday is the worst I've ever seen it. She had a complete mental breakdown where she was emotionally and physically assaulting her parents while I was at their house. Her mom told me she would like me to take her back to my house or they would resort to having an officer come remove her from their house. I wanted to go ahead and try to take her home with me to let everything cool down.

It was impossible trying to convince her. She stormed off and I knew I had to follow her because she was going to either harm herself really badly or damage other things. I kept trying to convince her to come back so I could take her to my house, but she just kept getting more angry. She threw her phone on the ground so I picked it up and kept it in my pocket. She kept telling me to give her back the phone but I wasn't because I knew she'd keep throwing it. Multiple times she tried to punch me and I had to restrain her a couple times to defend myself, and I feel horrible about it. She kept screaming as we were walking through neighborhoods with me trying to convince her to come home. Eventually someone called the police and the police stopped us on a sidewalk to talk to us. I tried to explain the situation the best I could. They decided to file a report for domestic aggravation because, unbeknownst to me at the time, I was covered in deep scratches and bleeding. They took her away in a patrol car because she decided to go to the hospital, where they eventually decided to send her to mental facility.

Now, she had been hospitalized in psychiatric care the last time she was manic, but I knew the events leading up to it pretty much necessitated she go. This time, everything happened so sudden. The night before she kept asking things like ""who was here"" and ""who were we with"" and ""someone stole my stuff."" She also kept saying she thought she was having false memories. We discovered this morning she was talking about Xanax, because her mom found them on her front porch, and said she would not be doing them in their house, and that's when my girlfriend lost it.

I feel so terrible. I also am being treated for bi-polar symptoms, and when she kept trying to hit me. I couldn't help but react to the emotional and physical pain I was experiencing and I said things like ""you are acting like a bad person. We need to go home"" and things like that. There was no time to think, and no time to adequately react and I feel so horrible.

The last thing she said to me last night is that we are no longer together and that she is blocking me on everything and that I don't really love her. I keep trying to tell her she's not alone and we all still care about her and I am with her every step of the way, and I am in love with her, but I know she's convinced otherwise. I think she really does hate me.

I don't know what to do this time. I've been there every step of the way with the different types of meltdowns and mania, but this time, I don't know what to do. I feel like a horrible person and I made things even worse, but I also don't know what to have done differently because everything happened so unexpectedly and everything was so quick and violent and I didn't know how to adjust.

I don't know what to do. I want to help her. I'm so depressed, and I know she feels so alone, and I just want to help her.

Throughout our relationship she has become so dependent on me, and there are times where I think it would be best we not be in a relationship so she can adjust back to life and be productive and be able to function in society and get her license and go to college and do all these things I know she wants to be able to do.

She is an amazing person. It's not fair she has to experience these types of issues. How I handled everything in the moment wasn't fair. I just feel so awful and want to help her so badly.

"Spouse of someone with bipolar type 2 here. Need some advice. My wife was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 just shy of two years ago. Her and I have been together for the better part of a decade, and I kind of suspected that she had bipolar disorder from early on in the relationship. Both of my siblings as well as my best friend growing up suffer from it as well. 

Anyway, long story short, her and I have worked with her doctors and newly found therapist very closely and have found a combination of medications and therapy that have worked wonders for her. I can't begin to tell you how proud I am that she has embraced the fact that she has this disorder and how far she has come in a short period of time. Her ups and downs are much less frequent than they used to be, and she has a much easier time suppressing her anger.

That being said, for the first time in about 4 or 5 months, she had a very violent and angry episode this past Thursday evening. I'll spare details, but her and I got into a small argument about something and before I was able to recognize the warning signs, she went into a fit of rage.

I've gone through many of these rage episodes with her over the years, and I know that there isn't a whole lot I can do. It's a Jekyll and Hyde moment, and I never fault her or blame her for them. I do whatever I can to try and help, get out of the way when I need to, and keep my eye on her so she doesn't hurt herself or others. 

But, this past episode was a little different. All of her rage was directed at me, which in and of itself isn't the first time that had happened. However, she's never hit me before. 

She didn't like slug me in the face or anything like that. But she kept forcefully shoving me to try and get me angry, taunting me to hit her. I will admit I lost my cool a little bit and yelled back at her, but I did not lay a finger on her. 

I sat down at my desk, and tried to exit the situation, as I have in the past. She started throwing things at me, none of which hit me. Then she got very close to me, grabbed me by the front of my t-shirt, and started punching me in the shoulder while screaming at me. I repeatedly told her to stop, but I knew that was in vain. There's no telling her what to do when she is mid-episode. I'm much larger than she is, so after getting hit about 15 or so times, I stood up, grabbed her firmly by the wrists and as gently as I could, put her on the floor. At that point, I felt like I had no other option, and she kept hitting harder and harder.

As soon as she hit the floor, it was like she snapped out of it and started crying and saying she was sorry. As I was on the floor with her, trying to console her to the best of my ability, I looked around and noticed the items that she threw at me, which included a pair of very sharp scissors, which looked to have only missed me by inches.

After a few minutes, she starts getting angry again. Even though I was trying to help, I said something that she didn't like, and I saw her lunge for said scissors, only to stop herself after a split second. 

It hit me like a ton of fucking bricks. She very well may have tried to stab me with those scissors. 

All in all, with the exception of the physical violence, this was a normal rage episode for her. None of her medications have been adjusted recently, and have been working very well for months. I really don't know what triggered the violence, however. 

Her therapist has recommended that I talk with her after her rage episodes, when she is in a good state of being, to help her try and identify what's happening when she gets angry. We did talk about this, but I just couldn't bring myself to talk about the scissors -- having them thrown at me, and witnessing her lunge for them after getting angry at me again. 

Part of me feels really unsafe. What if the next time this happens, we're in the kitchen and she goes for the knife block? 

I just really don't know how to navigate this without emotionally hurting her. I don't think she has any recollection of throwing scissors, or lunging for them later in the episode. She usually does 'blank out', for lack of a better term, most of what happens when she gets so angry.

She's a very loving, caring and supportive partner when she is in a good mental state. I know how much she loves and cares for me, and I think if I was to bring up the scissors incident to her, and how I'm now feeling unsafe, it would fucking crush her.....

....what do I do?

I always told her it was a 7 even when it was a 0. As a result i was diagnosed with dysthymia.

I haven't had an assesment done in 4 years, i'm in the process of getting a psychiatrist. I'm obviously not an expert but i'm like almost sure the issue is bipolar disorder. I can't think of another mental illness that explains why i'll be suicidal sometimes and sit in my room crying and other times i'll feel such strong and intense feelings of self love and energy.

He has rapid mood changes

He gets in some modes where he is on edge and there's no way I can even calm him down or talk logic to him.

He is a neat freak to the point where he will be so upset about small things being disorganized. 

He gets very productive and highly focused which can be great sometimes, but he doesn't understand why I can't be so hyper focused or productive like him. 

He will often talk so much and so quickly that he won't allow me to get a word in. Our arguments are basically him yelling at me and I can't get one word in.

I'm constantly afr

It seems like a lot of negative stuff, but despite these symptoms he's a great guy. I just don't know if I can deal with the way the things are going unless he can get some help. At times it feels like emotional abuse but I know that he can be better.

"Left hand right hand writing exercise Hello,

Yesterday, I had the most mentally and emotionally exhausting session with my therapist yet. They suggested I try a technique called the left hand right hand exercise, to help clarify my constant internal conflict over several things. The technique itself was deceptively simple. It involved writing all thoughts I felt were rational with my dominant hand, and the other thoughts, that I felt were emotional, with my other hand, on opposite sides of a piece of paper.

When I started off, I was unsure of what it was going to achieve, with me even writing these doubts down with my dominant hand at one point. Before I began, I was feeling neutral, which I like. Barely five minutes into the exercise, I had become this shivering mass of rage, depression and general feeling of being upset. My therapist had told me that this might happen, but the astonishing swiftness with which it did is what caught me off guard. They saw that it was too much for me to handle and called the exercise off. They then sent me on my way after ensuring I would be okay.

It took me hours to recover from that experience. In a way, I do feel it helped by concreting the incessant debate I have in my mind. It has made me aware that a lot of my severe mood swings are possibly because I never validate myself.

Has anybody else tried this technique before? If so, what was your experience during, and did you gain anything after? I would love some insight into this through your accounts.",bipolar

"I just got officially diagnosed with bipolar yesterday I don't know what to say, but I feel alone, so I am assuming this sub is okay with me posting this, so here it goes. 

I am not totally surprised, but I thought I just had severe Anxiety, and OCD, and now bipolar is added on top of all that I don't care about the stigma I just care about how damn painful it is just to live, and how many more hours I will suffer in the future, and the lack of control that I have over it at the moment. 

I can't brush my teeth without getting an anxiety attack or getting manic I regularly don't brush my teeth for 5 days or more because of this, and I can't take showers, clean my room, or do anything besides play video games ALL DAY we are talking like 14+ hours a day. I can't fucking survive my mind the chronic anxiety is stealing all of my will, and extra energy to do anything, and the constant pain of ALWAYS feeling like my house could catch on fire any second or my house getting robbed any second or anything of a catastrophizing nature. 

I talk to my mom, brother, therapist, and even strangers on the internet that have good intentions, and THANK YOU for that btw it really helps, but even with all of that, I can barely cope with the constant pain from all of my mental debuffs. Therapy is the only thing that significantly reduces the pain compared to anyone else, but since I am poor I had to stop going to therapy for like 2.5 months, and as a result, I am barely coping, but good news is I will start therapy again this week in like 2 days which is fucking amazing, but I may only be able to do it for like 2 weeks, and have to stop again.

I am not okay, and I have decided that I will have to go to therapy to survive/thrive, so I will legit sell me furniture, and pretty much anything I own to get enough money to go to therapy even if I only get 3 weeks of therapy, but realistically I don't think I will need to do that because my parents are finally able to get jobs soon, and they really want to help me get therapy.

I can't get a job even tho I really want to because I can't even brush my teeth without having a semi-breakdown I don't think I could hold down a job, and my psychiatrist said I shouldn't keep doing things that overwhelm me when I start feeling really manic, and that would be the ONLY way I know of to do things I can't do them without feeling intense anxiety or becoming manic, so idk what to do besides playing video games all day until I go to therapy then go from there. 

I want to do things I want to workout, clean my room, brush my damn teeth, and take showers I just can't fucking do it without getting manic or an anxiety attack, and when I try to do things my mom tells me that I am acting really hyper/wierd, and she says I seem very angry, and she is right I am livid, and I have to stop myself from flipping tables over, and breaking things. I am not mad at my mom tho I am just, so fucking angry that I have to suffer, and I don't know how to stop it. 

My guess on why I get angry is because it is an attempt to get a sense of control I don't consciously feel like I am trying to do that, but I bet that's it.

"on medication (ugh) but I find supermarkets send me hypomanic for half an hour or so...? hi everyone, not posted here for a while. 

 quick update for anyone interested: I was suicidal a month ago, but in the past month have managed to write 9k out of 12k for my dissertation, and two more 4k word essays, and been to Prague! So I've been pretty busy, things are great (but not too great, don't worry). My medication - abilify - has genuinely changed my life. Not yet lost the seroquel weight yet, but slowly slowly working on it. 

 Anyway, to the point of my post. Whenever I go into supermarkets (usually with my boyfriend), I go... up. I become a bit childlike, giggly, easily distractible, impulsive, and I want to buy random shit. Colours overwhelm me - the fruit section is the most beautiful thing the universe could have produced - the music they're playing is the best song for the situation - all the crowds moving together in harmony somehow proves and also disproves chaos theory (I'm not sure what chaos theory is, but in supermarkets I think I do). 

 My boyfriend notices, and usually we just go and sit down outside for ten minutes and it's all good. But sometimes I want to buy energy drinks and stay up forever and condoms so we can fuck forever and all the fruit because it is so beautiful, but these coloured pens are beautiful too and really shouldn't my life be as colourful as all this???! ! 

 So... yeah. Not sure if it's the crowds or the noise or the colours. I also find normal crowds weird. At gigs I feel like I'm coming up even when I've not taken anything. 

 Does anyone else... know how to combat this or why it happens? It wouldn't bother me only that my boyfriend notices it. I also find talking about mania, my thoughts speed up and my speech speeds up and I become much more 'up' than I was. 

 Sometimes I try to convince myself I am not bipolar but then this shit happens...

"help understanding the degenerative if not medicated thing... I'm bipolar 2, unmedicated. I have actually found that prescription medication makes me feel so much worse. When not medicated, if I eat healthy and exercise, practice mindfulness, and force myself to stay engaged, I find that I am, generally speaking, much better off. I am not symptom free, by any means. But my hypomania is actually a gift for the most part. No hallucinations or delusions, just increased productivity, a little more irritability, some irrational yet manageable anger, and, overall, I just feel so much more. I actually enjoy it for the most part (though sometimes it does escalate, but that is rare and still manageable, never truly dangerous).

I have a lot of writing to do for school and I had a panic attack yesterday (have meds for it), and I am finding it really hard to get anything done or stabilize. 

I know I'm not supposed to ask for medical advice, which I don't think I'm doing in this post, so I was wondering how other people cope with it beyond ""take your meds based on the time zone and try to work back to a normal schedule"" which I guess helps, but not too much. ",bipolar

"Guys, does this sound like Bipolar depression? Do I sound suicidal. Weird feelings. Please read carefully. Hello reddit!
First of all I am 20 years old male with no history of mental illnesses, no abuse, and a normal happy life, with happy family. I don't do drugs, but I smoke and drink, or used to drink a lot of coffee, before this happened.
My WEIRD MENTAL STATE? began 4 months ago.(22.07.2017 I DON'T GET IT HOW CAN THIS HAPPEN IN ONE DAY) I feel like something in my mind broke... And do you know the reason? I heard of someone(Chester From Linkin Park) who died by suicide. Since then, my life changed completely.


I don't know why.
I don't know how.
I don't know what to do next.


I suddenly asked myself: ""Why he did it, he had 6 kids, he had everything? What kind of force drive him to suicide? What stops me from doing it too?"" and then I experienced something strange, something confusing.
I have really hard time describing what is happening in my brain(nearly impossible), but i will try. Life feels meaningless without any apparent reason. I am constantly anxious, have less energy. I don't go outside as I used to. I am constantly in my home, searching google articles about mental issues and so on. I am constantly in my head.

My interest in people dissapeared. There are other weird feelings in my head (As I said, I can't trully describe them.)

**weird feeling**: Like I am somehow disconnected from my old life?

**weird feeling**: Like I am in a weird unsettled life state.

**weird feeling**: Scary/Terrifying/Real/ Scenarious in my head like for example ""My best friend ask me if I want to 
work with him(We had very succesfully store.) And I answer him, no I want to die"" etc. WHAT?!

**weird feeling**: Like when this happens EVERYTHING SEEMS DARKER AND DOOMED, LIKE IN A HORROR MOVIE?

**weird feeling**: I simply cannot get out of my head when it happens, constant negative thoughts(i listed them above) weird feeling in the stomach, feeling dissociated from sveryone, everything i imagine in my head, even my home seems dark and doomed?

**weird feeling**: Like life is meaningless?!? Without a reason???

**weird feeling**: It feels like i imagine waking up everyday but it feels like i am waking every minute.

**weird feeling**: Feels like I won't be here soon.(generated From the scary thoughts.

**weird feeling**: When I try to do something I can't do for long time. Eventually there is a weird feeling associated with a throughts like the above that doesn't allow me to do it. It is strange, feels like anxiety a bit, but not exactly.

**weird feeling**: When I am relatively okay, there is a feeling like I am anxious, idk strange feeling in the stomach(not exactly anxiety.) Can't fully describe it.

**weird feeling**: Like i am dissociated with life(not like the derealization stuff) - again I am not sure what it is it feels strange.

//////**weird feeling: Feeling like I don't want to get better.(This is the scariest one.)**//////

**weird feeling**: Feeling like years have passed between my old life and now.

**weird feeling**: Feeling like there is no emotional content in my memories.

**weird feeling**: Confusion if I am suicidal or not?!?!?!

**weird feeling**: Feeling like a wave between now and the future happens in my head and makes me feel tired and anxious.(This happens especially in the morning, when I stand up and stop being sleepy it dissapears.)

**weird feeling**: When I do something it randomly appears it is like a feeling of /suicidality/hopelessness/flying feeling/ (not sure can't describe it.) and when this happens there is a strike in my stomach.

**weird feeling**: There are pictures stuck in my head(2 or 3) mostly regarding to future. for example: me in the garden of my university walking - like i am looking at myself from a flying drone. they seem dark or super bright in my head.
**weird feeling**: Feeling that there is something wrong with my thinking pattern and my rational thinking.

**weird feeling**: Sudden feeling of being trapped(In life?). (It happens randomly.)

**weird feeling**: That I will suicide if I work, and since then I am not working.

**weird feeling**: Going out seems weird/scary/overwhelming/I don't know.

**weird feeling**: Something that happened a long time ago seems close, something that happened a short time ago feels far.
**weird feeling**: This is about babies. Somewhere I have read ""I don't want kids on this terrible world."" And now there is a weird feeling when I see a baby.

**weird feeling**: Everything seems darker. Like my vision changed.

**weird feeling**: When I read here on reddit someone who is suicidal/depressed etc. All of the feelings come back and it feels like i am feeling the same way as him. (When time passes I can see the difference.)

**AND THE MOST IMPORTANT** :WEIRD FEELING THAT IF I WORK/GO TO UNIVERSITY OR FEEL OVERWHELMED I WILL S....... FEELING THAT I AM ALREADY OVERWHELMED AND WILL S......

Update 0: I have days, when I feel relatively normal, but still those thoughts, feeling are in background accompanied by butterflies/knot in the stomach and a weird feeling.

Update 1: Yesterday I read somewhere that you are suicidal if you have desire to die. When I read this I had (? I am not sure what i felt -???Anxiety attack??? )and the thoughts felt so real like I am feeling the same way, it lasted about an hour then I felt normal, and the thoughts seemed less real.

Update 2: Last night I was laying in my bed and decided to go to the kitchen to smoke a ciggarete. I was relatively fine. I was sleepy. As I was smoking I suddently looked in the place where we are keeping the knives and imagined getting a knife and s...... I got intense strike in the stomach and like an urge to do it, it felt real. Then I tried to calm my self but the thought ""Life is meaningless"" with somekind of weird ??future?? feeling came. The strike in the stomach became more intense, I immediately went to my room. I was no longer sleeping, and started googling about suicidal thoughts/suicidality. Today I woke up with low mood and the pictures of yesterday stuck in my head, with a weird stomach feeling. Also while I am writing this there is a feeling/thoughts that I just don't want to admit it. And a confusion if I am suicidal?

I went to a psychiatrist, and told him about the throughts. He asked me if i have a plan or fantasie about.... Then I said no, but i see intrusive images. And he said that it is ocd.


I don't have much symptoms of depression. But I do have less/none interest in the things that used to be intrerested. I go less outside. I am more irritable. I can't tell if I have anxiety because I want it or because I don't. I am afraid of the summer comming, because I read somewhere that people often do it then and now it feels so damn real. It happened in one day I don't get it. Also I went to 4 Psychiatrists and 1 Psychologist, I asked them if this is Major Depresive Disorder, they said that it is unlikely, because I have very few symptoms, They asked me if i set goals to high and so on. And none of them said that it is major depresion, very unlikely. Also, for about two weeks I was relatively fine, the thoughts were still there, but seemed less likely. Then all of a sudden after i read about a guy who was suicidal. The thoughts came back and feel realer than the real. The scary thing is that there are feelings, not only thoughts. For example: Yesterday I read somewhere that you are suicidal if you have 100% desire to die. Then I got hit by (anxiety) not sure and the thoughts seemed even more real, like i really had a desire. It lasted about an hour then I calmed and the thoughts felt less real. Today the same thing happened. Today I also had pulsating neck pain on the right side.(Maybe it is sign of anixety?!?! Maybe not?!?) What the actual f**k??


I don't wish to not being born, to not exist or to not wake up tomorrow for example. But there is a strange, unexplainable feeling that makes me think I am suicidal. WTF? Also when I read somewhere that you should ignore or not give attention to the thoughts because it may become worse, I feel even more terrified because I can't ignore the thoughts. Also the feeling that I don't want to get better makes me more terrified. 

Does that sound like Active SI?

And many ??intrusive?? suicidal thoughts about 16 to be exact, I picked a lot of them while researching and now they are stuck in my head. But I will not list them because they may trigger someone.
I visited 5 psychiatrists, yet, no clear diagnosis. One of them suggested Adjustment Disorder, but I don't think that this is the case, exept I moved to new city(1 year ago.)(because I study there.), and had a lot of stress during exams, nothing more.

I've Googled a lot, about mental health issues, and visited few psychiatrists, one of them Suggested Adjustment Disorder, the second one suggested OCD, but still I am so confused.:

**Like today, was relatively good day, but those thoughts/feelings were in background like on a pause idk I can't describe it. And later like one of those thoughts/feelings enter my mind and my mood drops. Something like that i don't know.**

*There is like a weird feeling that tells me that I am suicidal. I never wished to not being born, not waking up etc.* WTF?!

1. Does this sound like  Bipolar?

2. Does this sound like  SI/Suicidality?

"Is it possible to not crash after mania? My partner [21] of 3.5 years is currently on his third hospitalization in a month for a two-month long manic episode that has delved into psychosis twice. All my research has led me to believe that he's going to come down and crash and feel terrible eventually, but that hasn't happened so far?

Right now, he's in the hospital and on risperidone twice daily. It has made him more grounded and he is owning up to his bipolar diagnosis (he was in big denial when he was admitted, kept saying he didn't understand why he was in the hospital and that he is not bipolar/manic), but he's also having...a great time in the hospital, which feels off to me. He's very talkative and social, making eye contact with people, and generally in good spirits and I don't know what to do with this because I've never seen him like this and it makes me think he's still manic/hypomanic. In my experience, no one has a great time at the hospital and is immediately ""cured""; just stabilized. It seems to me like he's acting the way he is acting because he can tell we're worried and is trying to appease us (he keeps saying he'll comply with treatment to make us feel better as if he's just humoring us and still not taking this seriously). So far he hasn't shown any understanding of/remorse for the destructive/abusive behavior he was exhibiting while manic. 

I'm trying not to dwell on it too much and am also trying to take space/time for myself, but I can't shake the feeling that this manic episode isn't over and that things are going to start escalating again once he's out of the hospital. This has been traumatic for me and I don't want to make assumptions or project my anxieties onto his experience, but I was under the impression that he would crash and feel terrible when he actually comes down. I want to be able to support him and stay by his side, but I'm so wary of his behavior because this is more or less what happened with his previous hospital stays and he kicked right back up into full blown mania shortly after being discharged before. All of my bipolar friends and bipolar-savvy social worker friends are equally puzzled by the way things are playing out.

Am I overthinking this? Is he just coming down slowly? Does that even happen? I'm not really looking for advice on what I can do because I understand I can't really do much at this point but continue to wait it out and take care of myself/give myself space, but this is starting to feel like it's never going to end and I'm just really confused/uncertain of what to expect next.

"Starting to notice weird side effects of lamictal Lamictal really seems to help with my depression. I tend to go on and off, this time I've  been on 200mg for about 6 months with minimal breaks which is the longest time I've lasted. 

However, I've noticed some strange things. I've been having crazy nightmares, for one. Because I usually have weird dreams, I didn't realize this at first, but I've noticed when I skip a night they aren't as bad. The dreams are so vivid, I wake up feeling like I've just seen a feature length film, or lived in one. Last night I was in a helicopter that flipped upside down and was falling toward the ground. I woke up feeling like I fell into my bed.

Aside from the nightmares, I seem to be slower than usual. My memory of words is kind of tripped up sometimes and my boyfriend noted that when I go to pick up a glass or something I miss it pretty often. Balance is a little off too sometimes.

Additionally, I've noticed changes in my period. Like spotting between some periods and having periods heavier than usual.

"Failure to React to Loss I found out a few hours ago one of my close friends and co-workers (also an ex-roommate) committed suicide last night. I found out at my earlier work shift.

I called my mom and asked her to bring my forgotten morning meds (lamital, lexapro, buspar) because I would no longer be able to wait it out. 

It seems everyone has had a more substantial reaction. I have shed no tears, I feel no loss. Maybe I'm still in shock? I took a nap, I'm back at work at a shift I picked up and the original person offered to take back up so I could process.

"What are your experiences with childhood bipolar disorder? My 7 year old was diagnosed with ADHD about a year ago. We tried two different medications but neither helped with his rapid speech and mood swings. I told his pediatrician and she just made jokes about kids being moody and talkative but it's not normal. A couple days out of the week he is so talkative that he literally can't stop. He moves from one topic to another without pause and he even continues to talk when he's alone. When he gets like this, he's full of energy and the slightest thing sets off an emotional outburst. Having to eat dinner/shower (things we do every night) throw him into a crying  rage fit.

"The more I feel like I'm improving, the more things stay the same. Hey guys. I haven't posted in a while. I mean I comment semi frequently but I haven't really thrown anything of my own out there. So I just thought I'd share. Maybe someone can relate, maybe I'll feel a little better just getting it off my chest. This turned out to be a long ramble and vent, so I don't blame you if you don't want to read it. I have no idea what I'm doing really. I'll probably delete this later.

I've been in limbo for the longest time now. Thankfully things aren't getting too worse but they sure aren't getting better ether.

Not really sure where to start with this, I've been a closed book for as long as I can remember. I don't really like talking about myself, until I get to know a person or a manic episode of some intensity strikes and then I'm over sharing. I'm sure some of you know how it is. You meet a person, your up for a change, and you forget you just known this person a short time, as far as you are concerned, this person has been your BFF for the past five years. I have no concept of time when I'm manic. Veering myself back on topic, I think thats my first point. I've gotten really good at being self aware and restraining myself when meeting new people. I don't think people get how tiring it is. Yes Depression can make you feel tired all the time, but so can mania, at least for me, when I'm actively fighting all the urges. So I'm kinda proud of that, you know? Being able to think before I say something and go. ""Hey me, now isn't time for that yet."" I've started trying to treat it almost like a mirror. Don't offer up anything personal until they do, and then try to make sure what I'm saying is on the same order of magnitude. If they mention being heartbroke don't spill the whole story of my ex-fiance in one fell swoop. give a chapter not the novel.

So, thats a thing. I've also gave up alcohol forever ago. You know? I'm eccentric enough without throwing booze in the mix. I can't feel it until its too late, exacerbating everything. I thought that was a good thing, but friends at the time didn't understand. Thought I was just being a stick in the mud. I even tried explaining it but some people just don't want to understand.

Another thing. Possibly the big one, is I'm extremely lonely. I live in a little town, there isn't much to do, and the nearest thing of any remote interest is a walmart about 3 hours away walking. I learned the hard way during a manic episode. So thats a minor thing, never done that again. but I digress. The point I wanted to get to was I've been forcing myself out of my element more trying to make friends and talk to people. I even started a guild on World of Warcraft and managed to keep it going for about 4 months. Its kinda falling apart now but I'm hanging in there. It was super fun while it lasted so theirs that. Like the thought of trying to convince people to join in something I've got going, or aksing to join others, used to terrify me. Its still a minor panic attack, but I can do it now at least. A sort of, duck your head down and run through it till its past sort of thing, but yeah. At least I'm trying now. My social anxiety used to be so bad, that even though I really enjoy the game I could never handle doing group content with people. Its stupid I know. Its just a game. But I really hate people sometimes. I don't have friends that play so thats not an option. Rather, I don't have friends that will play with me. So that kinda sucks. I kinda wish I could show them how well I'm doing on things now, you know? I've invited them to make a character and join me, but they dont seem to interested, so I'm not going to push it.

I think thats whats bothering me most lately. I wish I had people to share things with. I'll take a picture of the cat, or see something fun, and ill be like ""Hey, you know who would like this...."" then I'll get sad because I'm reminded of people who drifted away or cut contact.

For about the past 3 years now, I've just been kind of existing. This last year or so I've made some great strides to become more self aware of my actions and think before I act or speak, I'm forcing myself to interact with people more. (seriously, why is it so ridiculously hard to make lasting friendships as an adult?) But im still kinda just.. here. No matter how fast this hamster wheel is spinning I'm not going anywhere. just making myself more and more tired...

I have no idea what I'm rambling about really. I think I just needed to vent about some nonsense a while. Maybe a manic episode is coming on, I don't know. Maybe its just the heat getting to me.

"An open letter to my bipolar exSO I'm sorry.

I'm sorry I took your decision to not take your meds as a sign of recovery. I'm sorry it took me so long to encourage you to get back on them, and that by that time it was too late. I'm sorry my concern came off as nagging, that my skepticism of stopping therapy came off as lack of support, and me trying to talk came off as smothering. Most importantly, I'm sorry I allowed the hurt from words you spoke, to cause me to be spiteful and hurt you.

I love you.

I love the crease at the sides of your eyes you get when you get excited about something, the enthusiasm you have when teaching something. I love how kind you can be, and how you melt when you see a cute animal. I love how you love. The way you surprise me with little things like doing the dishes, or making me dinner; how you pull me close when we watch tv, stop me in the grocery store to kiss me, and how you scoop me up in the middle of night if I've drifted too far on my side of the bed. I love that you made an effort to spend time with my family, and integrating me into yours. I love the silly pet names, inside jokes, and made up songs. I love that we can talk about anything, even if it's hard; that we have faced so many new adventures together, good and bad, and seemingly made it out on top.

I wish you loved yourself.

I wish you saw yourself through my eyes, that you saw how much good is in you. I wish you saw that all is not lost. I wish you saw it's never too late to be who you want to be, that baby steps are still steps, and that asking for help is not a weakness. I wish you used all of that self hatred you have for yourself as a fuel to better your life, so that maybe you can live up to those high standards you've set for yourself, rather than let yourself slip deeper into this hole you've dug.

I hope you make some changes.

I genuinely, whole heartedly hope that you take your treatment seriously, I do not want to hear of you being hospitalized again. From the overspending, self indulgent, I don't need any body highs, to the regret, forfeiting life, and beating yourself up lows, I hope the cycle stops.

"Can't figure out which is (hypo)manic me and which is normal? feel like medicine takes something away from me I was diagnosed a couple of months ago.

Started lamictal, which erased depression but sent me on what I am pretty sure was a month or two long hypomania? There were certainly defined times where I can say YES I was

--but other times that were just me but more talkative, more setting goals etc. I became happy with my job--a job I've always hated. I decided I wanted to be successful, started working a ton of overtime. I did what I wanted when I wanted, this wasn't always crazy things--I played a lot of video games (something I usually regulate)--I ate out at every meal, spent tons of money on clothes I didn't need, etc.

I didn't even recognize the change at all until the rash lamictal gave me was too much and I had to quit completely. Within several days I felt a level of peace come over me. It was like an exhale after a month of going every which way. I cleaned my house for the first time in months. Did laundry after weeks of picking dirty clothes off the floor. Went grocery shopping. Did laundry. Where I felt energized and motivated before, I felt at peace now. I am somewhat religious, and felt more connected to God and myself, an realized that the medicine had taken that from me. 

So the question is, which is the real me? Because if the medicine is me 'normal' then I don't want that. If mania is what I consider peace--and it's something I've strived for constantly in my life, as there have been periods where that feeling has come back, then I would be willing to suffer through the depression to get there. 

There are symptoms fit in both of these states, what concerns me is the peaceful feeling does seem a little, I don't know. Otherworldly isn't the right word, but it seems like a 'gift.' However, during this state I do sleep consistently. If anything I just seem 'too' functional. I eat right, I meal plan and cook, I clean--does that sound like mania?

In the other state, I have a lot of energy but I don't clean, I don't cook, I seem to have lost my compass and forget about my principles. But then where are my principles coming from? A highly religious manic state? Or a state of normalcy and peace?

While waiting for my order to be remade she kept apologizing. She even gave me 2 free sodas without having to ask or expect them. She was sincerely nice and felt bad about the mistake.

All I could say was that it was no reason to worry, that it was my fault for not speaking clearly when initially ordering and saying thank you over and over again.

When I got home I locked myself in the bathroom and began to cry. Why was she so nice to me? I don't deserve it. She was such a pleasant human being that I wish her all the happiness in the world and it breaks my heart knowing that she probably gets rude customers every now and then.

"I hate that being bipolar made me fall in love so strongly. I fall in love so intense. The guy I fell in love with does not want to be with me ""anymore"" To be fair, he wasn't ever really mine. One of the first things he told me was that he had never been in love and probably wouldn't ever be.


He just wanted a ""special friend"". He wanted me to come visit him. I was hesitant and reluctant because of some stuff that I'm not comfortable sharing here and my bipolarity.
I told him about all that crap and he was okay with it.


So I went to him.. and fuck, it was some of the best days of my life. We had such a great time. Perfect fit from the start.


He talked about me meeting his family and going boating with then, didn't want me to go home, he almost cried at the airport. That made me hopeful.


It all started to sour after a while. We both realized he was totally bipolar, but he refused to get help. I came to visit him once more. I was so in love with him and it hurt to see him hurting and that he didn't  say all that good stuff about ""us"" anymore.


It went longer and longer between our chats
He wouldn't answer me for weeks. So I finally gave up a couple of days ago. Sent him a message wishing him all the best and hoping that he'd seek help. I told him that I knew that he didn't want a relationship but that I fell in love with him anyway. 


He actually answered that message, first time I heard from him in almost two months.


""It's unfortunate that you feel that way when our friendship was really good. Sad that it has to be black or white."" 


I'll never see him again, touch him, smell him, spoon him, talk to him. It's horrible and it overshadows all of the good things in my life. I can't sleep because I only think about him whenever I try. In a way I wish that I'd never met him.


I'll probably try to cope with this by sleeping around a lot. I usually do. Would be nice to channel it into something healthier though..

"I just turned 30. And I, once got again, truly do not think I'm capable of real love, or intimacy after day 5. And the thing thats starting to scare me the most is that I'm getting to be okay with it. So much of my life, so many of my mistakes, so much of my pain has come from that place of endless loneliness and an extreme desire to be wanted and to be loved. 

I know a lot of the way I feel is reactionary, but even when I've fallen into potentially good situations, my stomach gets tied in knots and I can't breathe. Seems that feeling is my normal.

I just don't want to fall into some pathetic existence for the rest of my life, slowly letting myself go because I don't have a reason to push myself anymore. Quiet, lazy pursuits have been enough. And when they aren't, I'll go out. I'll binge. And I'll lose days because my body can not handle hangovers like it used to

The last few years have been so awful. It's amazing I made it this far. I've lost everything again and have restarted my life. Moved across the country to get away from bad situations. Let my name get destroyed in the process by not fighting for it, because staying alive seemed more important

I guess, at the end of it all, I've lived my life in phases.  I fade in and out of peoples lives. Sometimes by my own volition or unease; most of the time because people can't ""handle me"" anymore, even after I've sacrificed so much for them.

Now I'm happy again. I cycle through mania and a normal state. I spend more money than usual but nothing that can't be budgeted for.

"Going back to school surrounded by triggers I'm a law student. I'm in my last semester of school. Everything started falling apart in August of 2015, climaxed in January/February of 2016, was diagnosed, went through treatment, and now have been doing decently well. I, by some miracle, got fantastic grades during my second year. I did an externship last semester to take some time off, but I just started school this past week for my last semester.  I have great grades and school habits so that's not what this about.

Most of my issues stem from social relationships I have. By being back at school, I am sent back to the really terrible moments of my life and see people that really hurt me. I am surrounded by a small clique of people who dropped me when things got bad in January. I tried to apologize, make up, etc., but honestly, they're pretty terrible people. Another ""friend"" of mine dropped me, then said she wanted to be friends, and the pattern just kept going back and forth. Seeing this clique and specifically this friend instantly triggers me. I start having an almost panic attack. Then, my mind goes down a deep rabbit hole of depressive and suicidal thoughts. I was free of these thoughts or anxiety for 3-4 months.

I just got home from my doctors office and she prescribed me Invega. I've never heard of it. She seemed really worried. She says she's afraid my condition is just going to keep deteriorating unless we figure something out.

I've been fairly stable for the last year, but voices in my head have started urging me to kill myself. It's really crazy how compelling someone telling you to do something from within your own head can be. You see this shit in movies and stuff but I never expected it to happen to me. I almost didn't have a choice but to obey. I managed to snap out of it I guess because I got really curious why this voice wanted me dead. Like was something really good about to happen to me and the voice was trying to prevent me from being happy, or was something horrible about to happen and the voice was trying to protect me? It was weird.

Also I've been seeing shadow people and shadow animals creeping around, and bright electric rainbow bugs crawling the walls. Things move out of the corners of my eyes all the time. There has been this glowing ball of light that has been plaguing me for months. Sometimes it's as big as a basketball and it flies around like looking in car windows and stuff.

"Perfect description of how my manic brain makes choices Found this on wikipedia:

""Existential angst"", sometimes called existential dread, anxiety, or anguish, is a term that is common to many existentialist thinkers. It is generally held to be a negative feeling arising from the experience of human freedom and responsibility. The archetypical example is the experience one has when standing on a cliff where one not only fears falling off it, but also dreads the possibility of throwing oneself off. In this experience that ""nothing is holding me back"", one senses the lack of anything that predetermines one to either throw oneself off or to stand still, and one experiences one's own freedom.[24]

Being manic truly feels like experiencing this freedom but choosing to jump off the cliff. By that I mean when I'm manic I choose to do the outlandish, wild, inappropriate, self-destructive thing because I feel that I have the freedom to do it. I don't feel dread though - instead I think I'm special for knowing that I have the freedom to ""jump off the cliff"" when most people don't realize they also have that freedom. It's too tempting when I'm manic to do the things I know other people won't - I do it subconsciously. 

My manic brain says to me ""Nothing is predetermined! You're free! So why not do a ton of drugs, binge drink, gamble all your money, and have sex with dozens of strangers? You can! You understand the meaning of life because you know you're free!"" No dread. Just the ridiculous belief that freedom means you should choose to do the thing most people would be too afraid to do.

"Trying and trying...but I'm starting to feel hopeless I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 last year after I was misdiagnosed with major depression, given antidepressants and went WAY too high. Probably the worst/most embarrassing manic episode w/psychosis of all time 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️ 

Anyhoo, I ended up getting fired from my job in a very exclusive industry (so I'm basically blacklisted :() and had these grandiose ideas that I was going to start my own company, which failed immensely bc I crashed into the worst depression of my life after the mania subsided. Haven't been able to find a full time job for like a year and 4 months bc my industry was so niche and my job title was very specific. 

I've been cycling through medications trying to find the right combo with minimal side effects (abilify made me gain 50 lbs in 3 months). I've kinda given up on therapy bc I hate talking to neurotypical people bc I feel like they're pitying me. Too depressed for any physical activity so I just lay in bed all day. 

I don't feel like myself anymore. I'm less friendly, less open, have trouble maintaining conversations bc my mind just feels blank all the time and I'm so insecure now. Not at all how I used to be. I was brilliant tbh 

I just moved in with my dad after living with my mom for a year. Since I wasn't improving with my mom, they thought my dad's tough love style would help more. I've only been here for a week so we'll see. I'm in a bumfuck state (CO) and I miss being in a major city like NYC or LA. Denver is so boring. I'm scared that I'll just be getting high all the time. 

I'm also ashamed bc I've been taking care of myself since 18 and now I've slid all the way backwards at 25yo to depending on my parents completely (financially, emotionally, etc). I'm such a burden to them even though they don't say it and don't make me feel that way. I really love them but I feel like I'm the shittiest daughter and example for my younger siblings now. 

I'm trying to work on my faith but it's so hard to have hope and belief in a higher power when I worked so hard for the life I had before and lost everything in the span of a month. 

I'm so sad and disappointed in myself even though I know my episodes aren't my fault. I've ruined all my friendships by snapping at them during depression then isolating myself.

I'm so alone 

Idk what I'm writing all of this for and I feel selfish for ranting but if someone has any insight or advice or positive words, I'd really appreciate it.

For the past week or so I've been waking up at 3am, working till 1 or 2pm napping for 1-2 hours between shifts, running errands, and then working again from 5pm till at least 10. I'm also house sitting for a few weeks so I have about 45 minutes of chores to to both in the morning and when I get home at night, leaving me with about 3 hours of sleep per night for a total of 4-5 hours a day.

But!!! The thing is that I feel great. It takes me about 3 alarms to wake up but when I'm up, I'm good! I've been nothing but chipper and eager to work at both jobs and people are taking notice (I'm usually a depressed piece of garbage).

"My first post, because reasons. You get it right? So I came here through a post that was talking about the degenerative effects of Bipolar. I was diagnosed with BP2 about 4 months ago, was taken off of effexor and put on lamictal. It helped me go from sitting in a recliner 24/7 almost, not wanting to leave the house, to taking a job working for the Navy as a contractor on a tropical island. Last Monday I had to rendezvous with a Destroyer fleet, board them during the middle of a storm using a rope ladder and install tracking equipment so they can conduct anti-submarine war games. Before I took this job I sent out a barrage of resumes as soon as I started getting better. My first hit was actually SpaceX out at Cape Canaveral. They had a phone interview with me, decided to move forward, then decided to change their mind. Forward to about 3 weeks ago, I receive an email stating they are interested in me for another position I applied for and wanted to do another phone interview. This time I made it to the in person interview, went all the way through it, felt I could do it, then on my drive off Cape Canaveral Air Force station I said fuck this shit and sent them an email saying I was no longer interested. I burnt myself out in the Air Force and I saw it happening all over again. They liked me so much we had a talk the next morning and they even offered me a 6 month temp position to make sure I wouldn't get burned out, but I still declined. They said they would love to have me so I can call them back in months or even a year and they said they'd work with me. I was an EMT before I joined the Air Force. You can see the pattern of stressful and excitng events I put myself in. As I've gotten older the crash and burn has just gotten worse. I've spent the last few days, at my aunts house in the same crippling position, sitting in a chair barely able to focus on a Youtube video just to keep my interest for a bit. Tuesday I was standing on the historic 39A Apollo launch pad with the career of my dreams in hand. Now here I am. My body feels like it's on fire. I feel like there's fluid moving around in my skull. My brain is fogged and I just want to do nothing. I'm dreading going back to work on the island and plan to just pay off my bills and come home and live off of my VA disability (90%). Life's hard. I just wanted to share my story. People praised me for the decision I made, knowing my health conditions (I also have scoliosis and bulging discs in my back and neck, also another mental ""resilience"" I've had to build."" If any of you have any similar insane stories, I'd love to hear them. ",bipolar

"almost irresistible urge to throw caution and meds to the wind and embrace who i'm meant to be christ alive but I'm tired of medication. Well, not tired at all actually so factually that's not even right. I might try again: I'm sick of the meds. I'm sick of my head and the way the world is so slow and sludge-filled and life is drudgery and misery and numbness. The world's shittest pink floyd song. I prefer the depression to this shite. This lead-brained existence isn't a life or right. Brain used to be like... kite-flying and high hills on breezy days and easy laughter and after the meds it's just the bottom of a fucking pond all stagnant and standing and stinking. 

 I already decided I wanted to lower the dose of meds so I did that and rid myself of a little of the numbness but some remains still. Lingers. Mingles with my thoughts and stops me studying. University is going to be impossible on them. My grades since going on medication have dropped by ~15%. I used to be so, so clever and now I struggle and muddle through but it's not enough It's not life. I'm not meant to live like this! I'm made for more extremes. The highs and lows might be scary sometimes but that's so much better than feeling like I'm already dead and buried. I might as well be, on the ridiculous chemical cosh that is quetiapine that they dole out and roll out with great fanfare to any fucker unlucky enough to see them on a bad day and get a bullshit diagnosis. 

Who the hell do they think they are? I asked my doctor if she'd ever taken quetiapine - she said the side effects aren't that bad - and she said no. So how can she tell me I'm making a big deal out of something she doesn't have any experience of? I'm sick of healthcare. I'm sick of the pharmacy's raised eyebrows and secret judgement when they hand me the chemical straitjackets. I'm sick of the blister packets, the dry mouth, the constant chalky tongue.

"I told my brother the truth today and he was skeptical. I'm heartbroken and scared. For some background, My brother is the closest person to me, but we have a very ""bro"" relationship. It's easy to talk about work, school and girls, but far harder to open up about feelings and hardships. 

Recently, My psychiatrist told me she believes I have BD after I went 4 days consuming only protein shakes and reading books about how to change the world. For 4 days, I was convinced I was going to travel the world and start high tech companies, and refused to leave my house because the mission was too important. I came crashing down from what I believe to be my first manic episode when i was hospitalized for being in a hypomanic state.

After being grounded and recovering, I read everything about BD, and was skeptical at first since my symptoms/diagnosis had earlier pointed to ADHD. However, when I looked back at my utter lack of control over my mood swings and manic reaction to ADHD medication, I was convinced that I may be bipolar.

It was so hard to admit that I may be bipolar even to myself, since my family is from conservative Asia and tends to be skeptical of western medicine in general. The stigma associates seeing a psychiatrist with mental retardation or outright lack of discipline. I know, it's horrible. 

Anyways, the first person I turned to about my recent suspicions was my brother. He had always been a huge supporter of mine. I told him everything in a private and quite restaurant, and the only thing he could focus on enough to say back was that all people experience those kinds of changes/insecurities/difficulties. He thinks I'm overthinking and seeing a specialist has gone to my head.

I don't know why this disease chose me. Everything came crashing down afterwards. I became angry, moody, agitated, stressed, frustrated. I lost friends as a result. I told them not to take it personally but my anger and moodiness got hold of me and they slowly stopped hanging out thinking that I hated them or vice versa. I became antisocial. My friend told me if I value the friendship I have to tell him what's going on but I got so pissed and the anger about what he did that I got him out of my life. The littlest things agitate me. I lost my gf long time ago. My family became quiet and not fun and enthusiastic because of my depression. Life is a mess.

"Anyone on seroquel/ quetiapine above 400mg? Hello everyone!
I'm curious about anyone on here that is on seroquel above 400mg... 

I just recently got out of treatment for 2nd time a couple months ago. My symptoms from the first time I went in about a year and a half ago was much different from the 2nd.

My diagnosis after my first round of treatment was generalized anxiety disorder and depression. While seeing a psychiatrist over the next year I was eventually on 300 mg of wellbutrin and 30mg of Mirtazapine/ Remeron.

Unfortunately as of the end of July I had to be hospitalized and go back into treatment because I became Manic for the first time ever. I finished treatment the second time around in September with a diagnosis of BIPOLAR 1 severe so I was put on seroquel.  I'm currently still in the process of working with my psychiatrist to find the right balance of meds that work for me. Over the holiday during Thanksgiving I wasn't able to sleep and was extremely restless... thankfully I was due to see my psychiatrist the following Tuesday. My seroquel was upped from 200 to 400,  we dialed my remeron back to 15 from 30 and my wellbutrin was unchanged at 300. I recently discovered that it is unfortunately the remeron that is making me restless so I wait until I'm literally about to fall asleep to take it and that has worked so far.  However when when I take my 400mg of seroquel it still takes me a good 2-3 hrs to get to sleep. I had a very strenuous workout tonight so I hope that helps.  But anyway that was a background to lead up to this question for those who are in a position to answer.... I suspect when I go back to my psychiatrist that he may take me off of the remeron all together and up my seroquel. I believe I've seen that the maximum dose reccomended for seroquel is around the 750-800 mg region. I feel that I've had positive results with the seroquel each time it is upped and dont feel tired the next day after waking... I honestly wake up feeling quite refreshed. I know everyone is different but I was just looking to see how common it is to be on a higher level of seroquel and that person's experience on that level.

I've never been on Aripiprazole, according to my psychiatrist it can have a calming effect though I've heard because it's a partial dopamine agonist it can be quite activating and cause issues with impulse control.

"Questions, Confusion, and Seeking knowledge Howdy everyone!

I've been recently diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder (Don't know where at on the spectrum) at a relatively late age (20). 

This comes after two-years of solely taking an anti-depressant (Zoloft) and not much therapy. That came at the age of 18. 

For most of my life, I had no idea that the issues I experienced were an indication that anything was wrong, and that I should talk to someone about it; until my senior year of high-school, I thought I was normal with quirks. It was then, having noticeable hypomanic and then a moderate depressive episode in the span of about one to one and a half years, that I realized something was wrong.

I've been doing much better since being very open about the struggle against my own mind, and being proactive and getting help. I regularly go to therapy now, and also am working my way into Lamictal tolerance (50mg now, going to 100mg by early April!). 

**I went so many years without doing anything about the issue, and more years not treating it correctly and stumbling around blindly**  (Still kinda am, that's why I'm here). 

**What I ask is this:**

1. What am I doing? I literally have no idea what to do about it besides medication and talking to a therapist. Do I avoid triggers? Do I condition myself to overcome triggers? Are there everyday triggers I don't even know about that run across the board?

1. How do you know if a medication is working for you or not? I know it's too early to tell for Lamictal, but I just have no idea how to tell if the 100mg is right for me after I'm on it for an extended period of time. I'm too passive when the psychiatrists ask questions because I don't know what to tell them. 

3. How do you separate a mood episode you may be in from yourself? I read the information packet my psychiatrist gave me, but I find it so hard to separate who I am from hypomanic or depressive symptoms. Is there even a separation? 

Sorry for the length of this post, and the (probably) simple/uneducated questions.

I just have never truly dealt with my Bipolar Disorder, so I have no working foundation or even idea of how to build one. 

I would truly appreciate information on these questions so I can work to build a better me and struggle against my mind (Is that even the correct thing to do?)

Thank you all for your time, and for your potential answers!

"[TW: Suicide] What is supposed to happen at emerg? Two days ago I went to my local emergency room because I am suicidal and was at risk of killing myself. I made it very clear to everyone that spoke with me that I was there because I want to kill myself and I have bipolar. I waited for about 7 hours in the waiting room alone and things kept getting worse. Eventually I was taken into an interview room (one with the chairs and small end table chained to the floor).

I told the nurse and doctor that a month prior I went to emerg because a new mood stabilizer was causing horrible side effects. The doctors a month ago told me there was nothing they could do to help me because I was not suicidal at the time. There were some very upsetting things that happened that visit but I was eventually able to see a phyciatrist who took me off those meds but left me on my SSRI and sent me home. (I have a history of manic episodes that lead me to the hospital because of thoughts of suicide before while only on my SSRI without a mood stabilizer)

This time at emerg I thought I'd be getting some treatment because this time I was actively suicidal. My doctor and nurse and the intake workers were aware I am suicidal, have a plan, and I even told them my plan. The doctor lectured me about doctor hoping (I haven't been able to see a psychiatrist or a doctor because I had moved in the past year, I don't have the finances to visit my old gp and I know I need to find a doctor in town but it's so hard. I'm not doctor hoping I just have to go to whoever can help me at the time of crisis so that). He sent a referral to a psychiatrist and sent me home with 3 pills of ativan which didn't help in the least.

I still want to die, even more so now. I told the nurse all of the services that had failed me in the past and that I felt this was my last shot. I don't know what to do. I feel like I need to be on different medication immediately (actually for about a month and a half) and I feel unsafe but every time I've gone to emerg- even while actively suicidal they've sent me home. I'm trying so hard to hold on for my boyfriend because I know how much he loves me and how much I love him and my friends would be deviated but I just don't want to feel like this anymore. I don't want the ups and downs to be so severe I want to want to be able to work and go to school and have a productive life but right now I'm just so sick and exhausted and apathetic. I don't know what to do because every time I reach a hand out for help it gets slapped down. I thought that this time since I really want to die, someone would help me.

Is this all they do at the hospital when you're suicidal? No one even mentioned staying in the short stay unit or admitting me they just sent me home. I wasn't even offered a suicide hotline number or the mobile crisis number.

"Inferiority complex? Is this part of bipolar? Since bipolar manifested in my teens I've had low self esteem with anxiety and limited social skills compounding it.

A couple of years ago I went to South Korea with my friends and experienced a lot of racism and sexism. Nothing could prepare me for it. I felt every stare and tensed up at every laugh and racist slur they thought I didn't understand. Really I thought it could be hypo making me hallucinate things. My friends are also POC and while they acknowledged it it didn't really seem to impact them as much as it did for me, which I found alarming. For me it was so great that even now I get really angry and uncomfortable recalling my time there, no matter how much I try and block it.

Once again I've put it down to being overly sensitive. Even my friends think so and thought it was dumb that I shut myself in our hotel for a few days. But I was derealizing hard meaning anxiety was through the roof and I needed to stay indoors.

"I'm told that anybody would want my life yet I prefer to be dead I'm on disability so I get paid to just take care of myself. I have a husband and 2 teenage children who love me and support me. I had a successful career 6 years ago before my diagnosis. I get along with all my siblings. I have very good friends. Yet I wish that I would stop existing. I am aware of my emotions (which are mostly negative) 24/7 and it's exhausting.  The longest I've been stable is 2 months at a time and I crash every time. I tried going back to work twice in the last 6 years and failed both times. I tried volunteering 7 different times but had to stop because it was making worse instead of better.

"Anyone working on any personal, distracting, or fun projects lately? TL;DR: Been going in and out of shitty then normal moods. I had a Raspberry Pi laying around so I've been keeping myself distracted with it successfully and I'm learning all about Linux and command lines. 😄

Currently going through a weird couple of weeks. A couple of days of depression or extreme irritability then I'll go to sleep and be normalish for a couple of days (still getting those random feelings of longing though). 

So I bought a Raspberry Pi 3, 2 months ago then tried turning it into a router and failed setting it up. It sat on the corner of my desk gathering dust. Somewhere in between then and now had heard about a new kind of VPN protocol, WireGuard. Even though its still in development you can use it if your Android ROM supports it or you're running Linux.

So I don't have root or a bootloader unlock on my phone to change my ROM and I'm all about that Windows life but I really wanted to try this shit out. I'm googling everywhere to find a way to get it to work on Windows. Then my Pi called out to me and said, ""my body is ready"". A quick email was sent to my VPN provider asking if it could be set up on a RPI3. The response I received was basically yes but they hadn't actually tried it yet but Raspbian (the OS) was based on Debian so it should work. They were even kind enough to give me a couple of links to point me in the right direction.

I find a guide and follow it step by step several times but can't get it to connect at all. Another email was sent to support with a copy of the installation lines. The response was something about a kernel and I needed to install the correct one. After alot of googling and reading plus breaking my Pi and resetting it, I finally did the smart thing and just came here to Reddit and posted my problem in the rpi subreddit. A kind person walked my through a few line commands and explained what the fuck a kernel was. I updated the kernel, got WireGuard connected and had no fucking clue what to do next.

So now I'm trying out the router idea again. I'm not going to say I'm a Linux god BUT I've learned what a kernel is, command lines really aren't intimidating and Reddit is fucking awesome. Currently I'm trying to set up a access point and a bridge to get it going. I'm still fucking it up horribly but I'm learning all kinds of cool shit along the way. I'll get bored of it eventually but it's a nice distraction at the minute. Hell I might try the coding guides that came preinstalled on the Pi. ",bipolar

"I feel like life is my enemy.  As far as my therapist and I can figure I was bipolar for 9 years before figuring out what was wrong and getting treatment. Since then it's been a series of successes that seem to only exist to set me up for an even worse failure. 

Two years ago I met a woman on tinder that's been so loyal to me no matter how shitty I've been.  We moved in together a year and a half ago but it was partially out of necessity. At one point I asked her to marry me and she said yes but it was soon followed by doubt that I was being manic and not making the decision for the right reasons. I treated her kinda shitty for the next year because I was so lost and wasn't sure what I actually wanted.

About 3 months ago we had to move because our roommate was shitty. After some really hard times I found a new job and felt like I wad figuring out what I really wanted. First and foremost was her. So we got a new place together that was just ours, no shitty situations to get in the way. Just as I thought things were going well and I might be happy she started being more distant than ever. 

I found out she was seeing someone else, and I as far as I can tell she hasn't slept with him but texts him every day and sees him at work often. (She's a bartender and he's comes into her work often). She always said I can read her texts if I want so I do now even though I never did before. She said recently that they maybe should be roommates. 

We worked really hard to get this place together and if this had happened a few months before I would understand because I was not being a good boyfriend. But now that we've decided to really try is when she starts seeing someone else. 

I feel like it was all just a setup by life to get my hopes up and knock me down. And the worst part is i feel like I deserve it. I haven't had sex since we moved in to this place but all I want is her. 

I think it's probably over for real but I don't know what to do. I feel like I can't keep living like this but I don't want her to leave and if she's going to i wish she'd just get it over with already. I'm so fucking lost and I don't want to live anymore but I don't want to kill myself because I'm afraid ill end up surviving but worse off, like brain damaged or something. 

I can't deal with it but I can't fix it either and I think I'm a terrible person. And I hate life more than ever because it seems to just be my enemy.  I don't know what to do anymore and I just want it to be over, just sleep and never wake up. ",bipolar

"how do i deal with being disabled??? Sup fellow bipolar spectrum sufferers! 

I am looking to hear from people who are in a similar place that I am in life and stumbled upon this amazing subreddit. Yesterday I was enjoying the warm weather and went for a walk, I bumped into an old co worker and we went for coffee and had a lot of catching up to do. The conversation turned to money as he noted that my once trendy appearance has slid more towards the homeless side of the scale. I briefly mentioned that I had not been able to work for 3 years and changed the topic. 

This guy is no master at the craft of conversation. 1 minute later again he brings up the topic of money and wants to know what im doing with my life. So I spill the beans, been on social assistance and working any temp job I can get my hands on for the last 2-3 years. This offended him apparently because he took another sip of his unfinished coffee, stood up, made some remarks about looking for the easy way thru life and left. 2 hours later I have a face book message the size of a small book telling me how disgusting it is that I would abuse social assistance to get out of going to work every day and suffering threw it as he dose every week. 

I know most people here will tell me he was wrong to say that or some thing similar, but I ( used to ) have a great amount of respect for him and now think that perhaps he is not wrong. Until I was 23 I was always working 1 or 2 jobs, as well as being self employed. Before I got a diagnosis I was let go from many jobs for not fitting in with co workers ( being anoying?) or missing shifts from over sleeping / feeling to shitty to come to work. I had better excuses but reddit gets the truth.  There is nothing physicaly stopping me from going down to the nearest marketing company and landing a rep or team leader position as I have done in the past. Nothing but crippling unmedicated invisible bipolar disorder...  

I cant help but feel like im gaining more then I will ever be able to give back to my country. its been on my mind before but the conversation is stirring these thoughts up again.

"Going crazy again *Update*
I called my doctor's office. I had recently became a new patient. This is the the second time, I have called them attempting to make an appointment for this recently and both times I received the same answer. They told me that they only schedule appointments two weeks out and they had no openings so call back on Monday. I want to break down right then and I was pacing the floor the when time. I decided to call my insurance company.
   I moved in November so I've had to change my health providers and so far all I had been able to get set up with was a primary care physician. I asked my insurance provider if I could seek a mental health professional without a referral because my doctor was unable to see me. She checked my plan and I was relieved to find out I could. She gave me five phone numbers to call.
   I called the first place, I was told that they no longer are in network with my provider and needed to update the website to show that. I called the second provider but it went to a clinic at an elementary school, I called their main branch and was told they had hired a new therapist and did not know when she would be available to start seeing patients. The third number was no longer a working number. The fourth number had only therapists on site and couldn't prescribe medication.
   I was hesitant on calling the fifth number because the do a lot of inpatient work. I have two kids and a dog. I couldn't handle how much I would worry about them if I had to do inpatient. They couldn't see me either but they gave me a number to try. I called the sixth place.
   By this time, my friend who is living in my basement had come upstairs and was surprised at how many places I had to call. I told the woman on the phone what was going on and she put me on hold. I told my friend that today was the best I had felt in a long time and I knew if I didn't get this done today, I might not be able to deal with everything tomorrow. I was on hold for 20 minutes. Eventually, another woman came on the line and I had to go over everything again. I finally got a yes. They got me in as soon as they could which will be next week. I am sorry for all the text, my mind has been racing and condensing my thoughts is hard.

"Lamictal and Mononessa? So.  I found out Lamictal makes birth control less effective from my healthcare provider at PP.  They said I would need to do the shit every 3 months but I said I would rather not, and asked if any other options would work (like the ring).  The nurse asked the doctor and came back to report that a higher estrogen BC might work and prescribed Mononessa.  


I called my Pdoc the next day and he said it should be fine until I see him on Friday.  

The nurse also urged me to not have any unprotected sex for at least a month as opposed to 7 days because I am on a pretty high dosage of Lamictal.  (100mgs 2x a day) .   She said since I have been on it for a few ki tis and increased to that dosage very slowly over time that I should be fine.

"PSA: Although you might think reading the news in a mixed episode is a good idea ;), shockingly it's not! Bit of a news junkie here and I know in general I should try to cut back, it's touch and go.

I managed to not check it at all today and thought, what's the harm for 10 minutes after I got home from class...

Well it resulted in me needing my husband to hold me and briefly entertaining the idea my husband and I should never to public events or take public transport again and that instead of sticking to our plan to move to the east coast in two years-that we should move to Canada instead. 

To be fair this is following an already awful mixed episode week where my brain was causing me distress simply from never being able to calm down down from having 5 thoughts at once, everything feeling uncomfortable, a feeling of a pro-longed anxiety attack, high energy, feeling like everyone hates me because my bipolar makes me weird and unlovable in genera and that I fail at everything I do, all the time-you know, the usual fun and self confidence a mixed state instills in us.

Listening to Russell Brand's podcast, homemade food, music and mediation are keeping me just this side of insane though thankfully.

"In the process of Rewiring Brain So I've finally become properly medicated, and I no longer feel alternating rushes of needing to build and needing to destroy, the need to be totally connected and the need to be alone, etc.

However, my brain feels-- flat. Or normal. Or something. Like I currently have a ton of things going on in my life, (new apartment, became an uncle, new job, etc) and I would previously be very stressed and like, trying to fix that stress with booze or alcohol or sex.

Now, I'm fine with it (I think-- I don't know what ""fine"" is), and not doing those things. So like, my use of substances and need for sex is at a different level, and while I recognize that may be good, it's weird being 27 and not knowing (again) where those things are.

"Bipolar or ADD? shit I'm sorry this is so long, if you can get through all of it thank you so much

Small backstory/context, I'm a 19 year old girl, I've been depressed for most of my life that I can remember, it got pretty bad in high school so in 11th grade I briefly went to therapy, got diagnosed bipolar 2 and took lamictal for a few months, hated it because it made me even more depressed, quit taking it and quit going to therapy. 

Fast forward to October 2017, I hit one of my lowest points mentally, dropped out of college and started therapy again; she recommended me to a psychiatrist, I got diagnosed bipolar 2 again, and got prescribed trileptal. It made me my mood super low pretty similar to lamictal. I told my psych this and she told me to keep taking it and also prescribed me Wellbutrin. The Wellbutrin helped a little bit, and I stopped taking the trileptal and I felt even better but my mood still dipped low more often than not. Also my whole life I've had a lot of trouble focusing/completing tasks/listening to people talking to me/remembering literally anything but I just always thought it was because of the depression or whatever, but it still hadn't gotten any better at that point. 

At my appointment 3 weeks ago I told my psych that I feel better but I really still can't focus for shit and my mind is still constantly racing, but not in a manic way, just in that I constantly jump from thing to thing and never finish anything kind of way. I also told her I stopped taking the trileptal and she was fine with that. She prescribed me Adderall, 20mg a day and then I'm also taking the Wellbutrin(300mg) and holy fucking shit this is the best I've felt in my whole damn life. I'm getting shit done, I can actually focus on tasks at work, I feel like my brain isn't actively trying to kill me. I haven't self harmed or wanted to self harm, I'm seriously looking into going back to school. It's amazing. My only problem is that my therapist was super super concerned when I told her about the Adderall and she said it wouldn't work and it would make me worse. Does this mean I'm not actually bipolar?

"Tried to kill my self last night I had a really lousy day yesterday, actually all weekend. I ended up working over 60 hours at work last week, including Saturday and Sunday. 

I am back in the house after having left the last time I was manic, and my kids are still not ok with me being here. One of them (my 18 year old) really yelled at me for playing my guitar (something I do to calm my anxiety, burn some energy, and help take my mind off my depression) and bothering him while he was playing a video game. 

Part of my wife's requirements for me being back in the house is that I will not antagonize the kids, yell at them, or try to parent them until we've established that I can be stable long term (a big part of this, which I agree with, is that mania presents as extreme anger, aggression, paranoia . . . not happy energy). 

So I just found my self trying to find a way to keep my mind off of how I was feeling, but I couldn't. I crawled into bed and tried to sleep, but that didn't work. I have a real problem with anxiety when I try to leave the house, but I took some Klonopin to try and get myself outside. But I couldn't find the energy to do it. 

I've been really depressed for weeks now. I just feel like I'm sinking lower and lower. I am tired of feeling like this. I just want it to end.

"How do you go about not fully identifying with this illness? Here's a bit of background-

I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 17, I rejected the diagnosis and went unmedicated for the better part of the next 5 years (I would say I was in a state of moderate ""flat"" depression for the majority of this period) . During this time I excelled at my job (oilfield electrician), I was even being groomed for a supervisor position. Then I had a manic episode last February that ended up with me spending a month in a psych ward. This was followed by the worst depression of my life, lasting over 6 months. Now my moods aren't as stable as I remember them being when I was unmedicated and I'm having a hard time, not so much coming to terms with the diagnosis but trying to go back to not having it be a focal point or excuse for the way I carry myself. 

I'm just trying to get back to when I took full responsibility for my actions and excelled even when I was a little down. I always had a distaste for people who love to play the victim but now I find myself often wallowing in self pity and it's incredibly discouraging. It seems like I'm only drifting farther and farther away from my core values. I don't want to go back to being in denial, I just want to go back to not obsessing over something that has no business being obsessed over. The more you focus on being bipolar, the more power it has over you, at least this has been my experience. 

I know firsthand that this illness can definitely have an effect on the way we think/carry ourselves but at the same time, it's not an excuse. The more we use bipolar as an excuse, the more we see ourselves as victims. The more we play the victim, the worse our chances are of leading a successful and productive life. 

I have lived the majority of my life as a productive, although slightly dejected member of society. I have lived with people who I have known since I was 5, who couldn't believe I was bipolar when I was ""rediagnosed"", and thats the life I'd like to lead again. I don't want to advertise my illness, when I do tell people, I want them to be surprised. Being a walking stereotype does nothing but perpetuate the stigma. I'm striving to be a good role model for others who share similar issues. I have a a pretty messed up albeit unique and in my opinion slightly prophetic origin story, I want my life's work to be to normalize mental illness. To do this however I'd first like to be established as a successful member of society.. So here's where I came from- 
I'm adopted, my BIO PARENTS MET IN A PSYCH WARD.. Both were developmentally disabled and forced to put me up for adoption, as they were incapable of raising me. Aunt on my bio dad's side adopts me. Bio dad has bipolar and aspergers as well as an unspecified learning disability. Bio mom can't read or write and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. My bio grandfather had a lobotomy in the 50'S. I'm still in contact with my bio parents but my grandparents on my bio dad's side have both passed away...so needless to say, I was destined to have a few quirks. Thankfully I didn't inherit any of the developmental issues that plagued my parents, at least as far as I can tell. 

The thing is, if I can survive this predicament and come out as a role model, not only for others with bipolar but for my friends, family and coworkers, then anything is possible. Now I'm on my journey to get back to the guy who was often told that he made others ""want to be a better person"". 

I'm a young gun and I'd really like to hear from some down to earth individuals who don't see themselves as victims! I'm looking for some honest wisdom from peers who are responsible and who see themselves as high functioning. A lot of the rhetoric here would lead a person to believe that living with bipolar is a death sentence and although sometimes it feels that way, it's really not but if you believe it to be, then it is. If you believe something to be true, then it is undeniably true from your point of view. Stay open minded and TRY! TRYING is the most important thing in this world, an honest effort goes a long way. 

That's what I know but this is what I want to figure out-

How did you manage to come to accept your diagnosis, without focusing precious time and energy thinking about it? 

How do you stay present and take responsibility of your actions, without blaming your illness?

"I should go to the hospital, but i dont know what to say or do. Any advice? I am in the worst depression in my entire life and I'm not even joking. This is no exaggeration.

The depression was triggered by me stopping Seroquel cold turkey on Tuesday last week... so there is nothing anyone can do about the depression. I have to wait until Seroquel kicks back in.

But I don't know what the hospital will/can do. So that's kind of why I'm hesitant about it all. I mean, it's just a waiting game at this point, and I've heard horror stories about inpatient (I've never been). I also wonder if they'll just send me home.

"So at the behest of my Psychiatrist and counselor, I'm reading through ""Full Catastrophe Living"" and *highly* recommend it to everyone here. I was recommended it for anxiety and ADHD, but I really see how it plays over to mood disorders. In fact I'm really learning that ADHD, or a wandering mind, is the foundation for many of the psychiatric disorders. I can't and won't take ADHD meds because I get addicted to them and go manic but I'm learning to pay attention through self-discipline, which is what the book is all about, ""paying attention, on purpose, as if your life depended on it.""

I know mindfulness works because it was taught bare bones in Star Wars and, when I was a child, I would pretend to be Jedi's in the backyard with my brother and would teach him to be ""mindful of the present moment,"" as I believe Qui-Gon said.

It's not a solution to deep-rooted anxiety issues, or issues that should be medicated, but if you're being counseled and are on meds, mindfulness is a good tool in the toolbox to have. Especially if you're a weightlifter or musician (I'm both [drummer])",bipolar
"I need some advice, and I'm not sure who to ask I have Bipolar 1, and after 6 years of instability, I've finally found a medication cocktail that stabilizes me. I'm going to school full time, I have a 4.0, I do my ADL, etc. The problem is that one of my medications caused serious weight gain.

This is where is gets a bit complicated; I have a history of anorexia nervosa restrictive type, and I was in the hospital for nearly two years trying to recover. I finally did, and I got to where I am now with a great support system and hard work.

I am now 15 to 20 pounds overweight. I don't care about how I look--I want to be healthy and feel more confident. However, in the past I've failed to lose weight on certain medications; this problem is compounded by a fear of relapse into anorexia. 

Losing weight on medications requires exercise, calorie counting, portion control, and a lot of triggers and ""problem behaviors"" of my eating disorder. 

Is there a way to lose weight that will allow me to stay stable and happy without relapsing into a mood episode or an eating disorder? Does anyone have advice?

To clarify, I'm not looking to lose tons of weight. I just want to be a healthy weight for my body.

So I've been searching for a job, without much luck. Last week I decided to send my resume to a staffing agency. The recruiter called me on Monday and scheduled an interview on Tuesday. When I interviewed with them, they mentioned an assignment that I was qualified for and asked if I would be interested in interviewing for it. I said ""sure,"" and I had my interview on Wednesday. I was the last person they interviewed and it must have been a quick decision, because I was offered the job 20 minutes after I left.

Now, I gotta say that I'm not super excited about the job since it's exactly what I was doing 15 years and a doctorate ago...for the same pay. BUT, it's a foot in the door and the hours are when my kids are in school.

I know it wasn't my fault the relationship collapsed. He treated me like garbage, cheating on me, scolding me for not keeping myself in check, and even going so far as to say I wasn't trying hard enough in improving myself. But after I told him, he said he wished we had known sooner because then maybe he would have worked with me, I could have gotten better before our relationship was ruined. 

I know this isn't fair of him to say. I was so angry and still am at him for saying that. We knew there was something wrong but he attributed it to me not trying rather than taking me seriously. I can't help but feel like me being bipolar just made the relationship unsalvageable. I know it's not my fault I am, but it hurts to think about. I know it wasn't all me but I can't stop thinking about it. I keep thinking about the way I handled everything, or rather didn't. I felt like a crazy person, screaming and kicking and scratching myself all over. And we had no idea what it was.

"What should I do in regards to my meds? I'm on Olanzapine, 10mg and have been since October however I've noticed some weight gain (the same if not more than when I was on Quetiapine) and I'm not happy about it. I'd also like something that slightly sedates me as Olanzapine doesn't do this.

I have started at a local gym but haven't been going long enough to see any results however I'm also still eating everything in sight.

Apart from the weight gain (which is rather annoying as I'm already body conscious) Olanzapine's been good, too good almost as if it's a placebo.

The only sticking point with getting my meds adjusted is that it will notify the DVLA (UK version of the DMV) and my provisional licence application will de denied. 

What do you think I should do? Do you think I should change meds & face the consequences with the DVLA, wait for my DVLA application to go through then get meds changed or just stick with Olanzapine and continue with the gym?

"Blackout in Mania - or something else? Hey, guys. 

On Saturday I went to a wedding and had a beer, a glass of wine, and two shots over the span of 4-5 hours. On top of that, I ate a bunch of food and drank an insane amount of water - like 10-12 glasses over this period. 

However, I blacked out, couldn't speak and threw up at the reception. It was so bad that my friends were convinced I mixed alcohol with opiates - which is insane because I do not take pills recreationally and try to get off of them ASAP when prescribed. 

I've been manic for awhile but this whole thing has kinda freaked me out big time. I'm not on any medication for my bipolar disorder as, as stupid as it may be, I've felt I could usually harness the mania. 

Idk, I'm just wondering if this seems like a realistic issue? I've thought maybe I was drugged as my glass of wine was at my table when I walked around and that's the last drink I can remember. But I can't think of anyone who would have possibly done that, unless it was for sabotage purposes more than rape purposes as I am the ""crazy"" one and not everyone was stoked I was even invited to this wedding. 

But that just seems like I'm paranoid. 

I don't know but I really fucked up. Like most of my friends are my coworkers and I called today off (a bunch of them aren't even back in town yet) to try to figure out what's going on with me.

I don't have some of my typical symptoms of either episode like hyperactivity, hallucinations, SI, etc... so maybe this is what I experience now while medicated?

"What does it feel like when your medication is working correctly? I've struggled with mental illness for as long as I can remember, but only within the last few months was I diagnosed as bipolar 2. I've been misdiagnosed as just depressed for years. 

From age 19 until 6 months ago (I'm 23 now), I was on lexapro. It didn't do anything substantial. I still had mood swings, most of them downward. When I'm manic, I feel normal. Only when it subsides do I even realize I had even been manic.  Most of my manic behavior is shit like sleeping with random people from tinder, spending $600 in an hour, impulsive tattoos, yadda yadda.

"Hypomanic Child Depressed Adult TL;DR: can you cycle over the course of a decade instead of a few months? Was mostly a hypomanic child, a mixed state teen and a depressed adult.  

Got diagnosed with Bipolar 2 last year after years of suspecting that was my problem. Mainly because the antidepressants I had been on didn't work and I didn't feel better until I was put on lamictal. 

So I still struggle with whether or not I am unipolar or bipolar. Them I was talking to my new psychiatrist about my over sleeping and mentioned I was the opposite as a baby. I would stay awake for 20 hours. That went on for months. He said I was a hypomanic baby. 

That got my mom and I thinking of my early life. While I remember being sad and crying for no reason at times I also exhibited a lot of signs of hypomania. Around 12 (start of puberty) depression really took hold. 

I think I was in a mixed state in high school. Taking all AP courses and running several of the extra curricular programs. I would go without much sleep and constantly push myself despite feeling depressed. 

Then in college everything changed. The energy and drive I had in high school that had resulted in being valedictorian and winning thousands of dollars in scholarships ended abruptly. I slept through my classes and threatened to quit every semester. 

I was diagnosed with depression at age 20. Put on a multitude of SSRIs and SNRIs. None of which worked. I had no side effects whatsoever. It was like taking a sugar pill. I was dumped by mulitie doctors when they started to suspect bipolar.

After my bipolar diagnosis I was put on Abilify which helped greatly. After a few months I was hypomanic creating non stop. Due to significant weight gain and a myriad of side effects, I came off and was switched to an SNRI with the thought it would work better this time since I was on a mood stabilizer. 

The hypomania is gone. An overwhelming depression rules my life. I now have severe side effects - something I didn't have when I was on anti depressants without a mood stabilizer.  I keep having my meds switched and am being told I have to give them several weeks before I could see improvement. Meanwhile I'm in a very dark place. The kind of depression so strong it takes your breath away and you wonder if you'll ever breathe again. 

I guess my question is this. Can you cycle over the course of a decade instead of a few months? 0-10 mostly hypomanic 10-20 a mixed state 20-30 depression.

"20 different issues: addiction to ambien, changing lamictal, lost insurance for 3 months, what is self-medication... the list goes on I'm hypomanic right now and and it's 2 am and I have to be at work in 2 hours if I don't decide to call in. I've had 4 hours of sleep in the past two days and I really, really need some help.

I'm just gonna dump all the things that are on my mind in a random way so here goes, apologize for the length, I'm sure this will be a long post...

* I smoked some bud for the first time in over 100 days yesterday. I did it because I used to smoke often (while on a cocktail of other drugs) and it helped a lot. Over time, my brain gets really stressed out and it honestly feels like I'm losing my mind if I don't periodically ""dump"" my brain out of my head by getting it super blazed. I'm not high now; it's been about 7 hours since I last smoked.
* 54 days ago I stopped a 5 year addiction to ambien. I took 10mg almost every night for 5 years. I stopped because my new wife doesn't like how I act on it, and because I hated how it made me want to take an ambien at 8pm every night and not eat dinner until 5 minutes after ingesting the ambien just to get high. I abused it for a long time. I have a lot of lost memories thanks to ambien. Not a whole lot of dangerous stories, just a lot of weird stuff and kinky sex. I miss ambien dearly. I don't know how I am going to function the rest of my life, and don't know if I want to.
* I'm out of insurance right now. My wife and I got great new jobs at the same time, but unfortunately that means no insurance for 3 months total. I quit ambien a week or two before this switch occurred, so I have no way to really talk with my PDOC and have her help in getting through this. She helped me get off Valium, which was awesome, but I don't know if I can get off the ambien long term.
* On the other hand, it's been over 50 days. All the physical effects are gone. It's just the mental part now. And occasionally when I get manic of course.
* I also had to switch to 100mg of Lamictal twice a day rather than doing the 24 hour Lamictal XR. Insurance made the XR $5. Without it it's a few hundred dollars, while the regular Lamictal is just $30 without insurance. No choice there.
* \^ Because of this, anything that I'm going through, the near constant anxiety, the withdrawals from ambien at night, the energy I get after taking Lamictal (I think?), etc, can all be doubted. It could all just be from cutting my lamictal in half and taking the regular one instead of the XR.
* My anxiety has been *so* bad lately that I am this close to buying a bottle of whiskey and a pack of cigarettes and going to town... even though I haven't drank in over 5 years.
* \^ This is the reason I also decided to smoke. Out of Ambien, Alcohol, Ciggs, meth, etc., I'd rather use pot if I had to choose one.
* \^ But... it looks like pot can make me become hypomanic. Obviously. I only smoked three times today (morning, twice in the evening) and I made sure to not smoke within three hours that I had to go to bed. Yet despite the calming music, the near constant CBD vaping, the relaxing tea, the hot shower, and the amazing cuddles from my wife (and cat) I am wired and ready to go smoke another bowl and play video games. **I really wish I had an ambien right now.**
* I also don't want an ambien. I lost out on a lot of time in my life when adding up all the things I did after I was supposed to go to bed. It also makes me sleep a lot more. The main thing though is that it took away from my relationship with my wife. I craved that ambien high so much that I would sometimes not even pay attention to my wife and be in the moment with her, just itching to get that ambien.
* \^ that being said, I also craved the high. 20-30 minutes of pure bliss. Almost guaranteed. Every night before bed. It was a great way to finish my day no matter how stressful my day was.
* My wife is opposed to me getting on ambien (with good reason). When I mention maybe just 5mg a night or not every night or just 4 ambien a month for emergencies, she always says no.
* \^ I feel like this is a big issue because my mental health is my mental health. I abuse every drug I can pretty much, that is agreed, but maybe I just need to lower some. Maybe the headaches I got from ambien were from coffee
* \^ I quit coffee and ambien at the same time and after about 4 weeks they went away. I'm still not sure if it was the ambien or the coffee or both that caused the tension in my head every morning. Again, made two changes at once there, so not sure about any results.
* I'm going to therapy with my wife soon, but she won't talk about herself. Just us. My wife also has depression and doesn't take any meds or see a therapist.
* I was on valium for about 5 years too but I quit in December. **I had to taper off for months to get off that shit. I hate being addicted or needing a pill for anything.**
* I thought weed would help my mood, and get rid of my anxiety because weed like I said has a way of making me face all my fears and anxieties. And that's what I've been doing for the past two days: facing my fears and anxieties while high... and it worked! It feels great. But now I'm manic and can't sleep. I don't live in a legal state, so I'm not sure about what I'm buying most of the time.
* I have to go to work in 2 hours. Or supposed to. I'm going to call in, because there's no way in hell I'll be able to function off two hours of sleep. But my wife works 45 hours a week while I work 30 (if that) and I feel so fucking shitty knowing I barely can work while she can work way more than me.
* I don't know if I want to smoke weed or not. I like having my anxiety lifted, not having to fight through it, even if that means less anxiety on the other side. It also costs a lot of money, my wife and I both broke our budget by dipping into a lot of weed stuff this week when we decided to start smoking again.
* I'd rather pop an ambien every night for my ""outlet"" but I don't want to have any health effects or piss off my wife.

"Are mood swings a common problem without being bipolar? Sorry if this breaks any rules as I've read the part about not self-diagnosing. I'm actually going to call and see a psychiatrist but for now I'm just stuck in my head thinking. However bipolar disorder runs in my family and now I can't stop fearing the worst.

The past few months have been hard but good.  I've overcame an addiction and have made steps to improve my life, but it's not all sunshine and rainbows. I feel myself slowly relapsing into full-blown addiction. Some days I'll feel great and not even think about my addiction. Other days I'll relapse. Nothing crazy like I used to, but moderately. It no longer comes first.

Anyway, some days I feel so good about myself.  I don't care what people think as I've become a better person, and am going to keep improving. Other days I'll feel like shit. The depression creeps in and I just can't think straight. Some days I'll tear up over nothing serious, just thoughts. It makes my life hell. I'm fine physically, but mentally I am a God damn disaster. If you read this far, thanks. I hope I'm reading too far into this but the way I feel hits every mark on a 'bipolar symptoms' list. Is it possible that my mood can switch every couple days without being bipolar?

"How to help the people you care about Understand Hey everyone - I was hoping you guys could give me some advice about how to communicate the nature of my illness to my SO. Also, long post, sorry. Skip to the end if you don't want to hear me ramble.

So four years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar I with psychotic features (though, the doctors are treating it more like schizoaffective now, and I have no idea if my official diagnosis has changed), and I *mostly* have it under control. The only real problem is the psychotic episodes, which keep happening because I hate taking antipsychotics.

Anyway, I'm stable enough to have a job, and worked up the courage to start a relationship. In the past I've dated people who also have mood disorder issues, and it...hasn't worked out that well, like 80% of the time. So I decided to go a different route, and date a person who is possibly the most optimistic, happy person I've ever met.

For the most part it's great; I have awful, awful family issues and lots of friends who frustrate the hell out of me or worry me a lot, and so having someone in my life with no oppressively heavy baggage, and who practically exudes palpable positivity, has been a huge relief. The problem is that, as far as I know, that kind of optimism is only possible if you're somewhat sheltered, and from what I can tell, that's sort of the case here.

It's not that he lacks sympathy, or directly belittles what I go through or anything - he looks heartbroken when I talk about some of my symptoms. He also isn't one of those people who urge you to try to come off your medication; he even picked mine up for me when I was too sick to do so. And even though it's hard to hear when I'm feeling unwell, his unwavering faith that ""I can do it!"" is appreciated. The problem is, I feel that he doesn't exactly understand just how hard that is, and what the consequences of failing might be.

I don't know many people who really get what's going on - my doctors call me 'high functioning' and I'm stubborn, ambitious, and can't cope with feeling weak. So people who haven't actually seen me at my worst tend to think, ""oh, well, they have a master's degree and have a demanding job in the tech industry, they must have their life together"". And I like it that way. But I can't exactly have my SO thinking like that. It just won't work out.

I guess it's just....if I talk about feeling suicidal, I don't need to hear ""Don't do that!"". When I'm dealing with psychotic paranoia comments like ""It's not real, it's just in your head"" don't make me less afraid. When I convey frankly that I'm terrified that I'll ruin his life - an idea enforced by an past abusive partner that blamed me for his breakdown, along with years of depression...not to mention classic academic impostor syndrome - I don't want to just hear what I already know. Yes, I know I deserve to be happy, I know I can potentially do good things with my life - but it will probably take years of work on my part to actually be able to believe that.

So I guess I'm wondering...how do you explain compulsive suicidal thoughts to someone who has never had to deal with anything close to that? How do you explain an unjustified low sense of self-worth to someone who has never dealt with extended periods of depression? How do you explain delusion and paranoia to someone who has no idea how much damage they can do? I honestly have no clue, so I was hoping some of you might have some ideas.

All I wanted to do was lie in bed in the dark and do nothing. But my boyfriend decided he wanted to watch a movie in the bedroom. He did ask me if it was okay and I said yes. But it slowly annoyed me more and more and more. To the point where I left the room. I am now finding it hard to focus on anything other than my annoyance which has slowly been turning into rage. I can feel my heart beating faster and felt my breathing change. I took 25 mg of Seroquel to hopefully calm the fuck down about a half hour ago. No change. And I shouldn't take any more.

Outwardly I'm calm. And I'm not suicidal. But I'm concerned and irrationally angry. What warrants a trip to the ER or Emergency Mental Health Services for hospitalizations?

"I learned something important about this illness and I'd like to share Hi everyone, longtime lurker, recent commenter, finally have the courage to post. I'm type 2, currently baseline as I'm writing this. Something one of my good friends told me (she's type 1) that she learned in therapy really stuck with me and I remembered it today, and it gives me some comfort at times. Her therapist basically told her this (my TLDR):

This illness is hard. It can be hard on you and the people around you, and a lot of people feel some guilt at some point or another for being afflicted with mental illness. But there's an importance in differentiating *yourself* and *your illness*, because they aren't one in the same. There's a difference between behaviors that are truly deviant (harming yourself and others, alcohol and drug abuse, putting yourself in dangerous situations) and personality traits that may just be...you. Being weird and liking weird things is okay. Being loud and silly and sociable and having a quirky sense of humor is okay. Being quiet and introverted and enjoying your solitude is okay. Being a massive comic nerd is okay. Collecting pocket watches is okay. And learning to understand the difference between a symptom and an *actual* part of *you* can often make the days a bit lighter and ease that guilt. 

I thought it was an interesting idea and it really resonated with me. I've always fit the ""crazy artist"" trope and I believed that it was because of this illness, but now I'm wondering if I'm just creative and passionate and weird. This is in no way meant to enable or dissuade anyone from leaving their current treatment plans (please take your meds if you need them! Drink water!), I just thought that different perspective was an intriguing way to look at BP more objectively and with a little more peace. What do you guys think?",bipolar

2. Should I talk to my psychiatrist about maybe pairing this with an anti-depressant?

3. From studies published online (some of which have a small sample size), I understand that this works for people with bipolar. However, user reviews aren't extremely high.

Then I started work and asked a stupid question that snowballed and more and more people got involved and now there is massive confusion. I emailed my bosses and asked them for help getting out of the mess.

I would just spend the rest of the day in bed except I have an event for my son tonight. I already hate interacting with other parents and it is 3 hours of that.

How do I turn the day around? Any advice?",bipolar
"Do you feel sabotaged by your parents? Hi all, I'll try to keep this brief as I have a long history of pain and reconciliation with my parents but at the age of 27 I'm finally accepting that they really would rather me dead (they're narcissists) and I have no recourse in life. 

I was born in Florida, then moved to Wisconsin for most of my upbringing, now I live in BC, Canada since age 15 with my immediate family. We are estranged from our extended family in Florida (VERY estranged) so I have only had my folks (and sisters, but they're narcissists too). We live in the most expensive part of Canada. My parents have always been obsessed with themselves and their relationship--my dad is a hoarder, financially abuses my mom, has a short fuse, he's always felt like more of a useless step-brother than an actual dad. He also cheated on her when I was in 6th grade and my mom has never ever ever let it go. I begged her to leave him at the time but he attempted suicide and then....all was forgotten? he was let back in without any conversation. My mom is always talking about leaving--seriously, since I can remember talking and walking my mom has always threatened to leave. She's always threatened suicide. She is incredibly emotionally dependent on me and my sisters, to the point where I feel trapped by her. I'm not an adult, I may as well be a child while living with them. 
They have not encouraged me to succeed, kicked me out multiple times over made up reasons (saying I was addicted to coke--rest-assured, strangers of the internet, I was NOT addicted to coke. in fact my golden child sister, who was not kicked out, did coke regularly) They've been suicidal and are also bipolar so they roll their eyes at my bipolar disorder. They've resented us our entire life and resent us for not succeeding while doing nothing to ensure that we can make it. (my older sister is currently unemployed for the past six years and lives downtown off her boyfriend's salary, so we don't talk)

I feel sooooo bitter about other people who's parents are supportive, people who have graduated school and have their own places now because their parents wanted better for them. I've been suicidal for years because I feel so unwanted by my family (my mom has said since infancy that we ruined her life).

People say to get away from your family and I did that twice. I came back last year and now I'm dropping school because I'm too suicidal. I've finally accepted that I'm Bipolar I and ready to do medication but people don't understand what it's like to only have your family, have no one else but these assholes to rely on, I really feel like ending it all. I even pursued abusive relationships to get out. I'm so resentful that they took us so far away from anyone who could maybe provide other support. It's always been what my parents wanted, I've always had to be their therapist, now I want to burn the house down but the only reason I'm sticking around is because of my cats who wouldn't understand where I went.

I want to move out but I'm once again in dead end jobs with no ladder to climb. My GC sister went back to school and now earns $45k a year, and still acts like she doesn't have enough to move out. It makes me want to scream and rip my hair out. If I were earning $45k I'd gtfo immediately. I've had to move out twice with no money while she never had to move out, and now she thinks $45k isn't enough to move out on? Guys, I can't do it. I can't live in this family any longer. 

People really hate poor depressed people and I feel it so strongly, society doesn't want me. I could get away from my family but then I'd be struggling to pay rent because they stupidly brought us to the most expensive city in Canada with the least amount of opportunities. (I can't do therapy btw because it's too expensive and last time I pursued free therapy it made me suicidal)",bipolar

"Dealing with annoying Seroquel side effects. So for some random ass reason Seroquel has been giving anxiety attacks. Rapid heart rate, having to pace around all that fun stuff. Sometimes even hallucinate if I start feeling worse. 

I've been taking Seroquel for over a year and never had any problems until like 3 weeks ago. Was at 600mg but because I started getting panic attacks from it I had to jump back down to 300mg. 

I still get the anxiety feeling but it's not as bad as it would be if I took a higher dose. 

Pretty much I've been having mini heart attacks every night for the last couple days. Doc already knows, but doesnt want to change anything about it just yet. Not till my next appointment.

Anyone know what I can do that helps with this? Or at least something that can keep my pulse rate from hitting 130? ",bipolar
"Alternatives to Rexulti or Effexor XR My psych diagnosed me with slight mood disorder and add so I'm currently on wellbutrin xl 300 mg, rexulti 1.0 mg, effexor xr 37.5 twice daily taken at same time which is 75 mg (but the 75 mg capsule affects me in a negative way despite being same dose so I need the two 37.5s), xanax 0.5 mg, and adderall xr 25 mg.

My weight gain has been from rexulti 1.0 mg which is necessary to help stabilize my mood in a tremendous way. I noticed when I did take the one effexor xr 75 mg capsule I didnt need the rexulti 1.0 mg as much but I felt more in my head or according to some people who may be toxic to me said I looked more medicated whatever that means so I take two 37.5 mg of effexor xr now and dont look as medicated.

My personal life has gotten better but I'm still struggling to pass my bar exam and hold down a job. My psych gave me naltrexone 50 mg to help lose weight but I stopped taking it as it irritated my mood a little bit. At one point I was just taking lexapro 10 mg with adderall xr 25 mg but lexapro kept me in a very lethargic odd state of mind which is why effexor xr was the better choice. I guess if anyone has similar med experiences and wants to share I'm thinking of asking my psych to go back to 75 mg capsules once a day instead of two 37.5 mgs and see if I can get rid of the rexulti but I def felt very different for some reason. Thank you for sharing in advance. ",bipolar

"Lithium and bloating I have been on lithium for about 2 years now mixed with prn zyprexa and my weight went up 40 lbs. When I go to visit my mom she thinks I look very puffy. I noticed yesterday I have swollen feet and ankles. My thyroid gland is enlarged and I have visceral pain in the right side of my back. I just got fed up and cut my dose in half without telling my doctor and ditching zyprexa for good. I don't believe they are helping at all and I think my physical health is just as important as my mental health. I just don't think it is worth it to be on these medications if they are making me obese. I am also on lamictal, wellbutrin, and klonopin. I saw a major improvement in my mood once wellbutrin was added. I don't believe I get manic enough to even be on lithium or an antipsychotic. I never go days without sleep because I want to and I do not get psychotic. Hell that makes me doubt I have this disorder and maybe I am diagnosed incorrectly.",bipolar

"Lamotrigine side effects? Managing brain fog Hello all! I've just been prescribed Lamotrigine for bipolar l, but was reading on this subreddit that some people have short-term memory loss from it. 

The reason I decided to seek medical help in the first place was because my depression had gotten so bad I couldn't, uhh, manage it with sheer willpower alone. I started getting brain fog, couldn't concentrate, and sometimes couldn't even get out a sentence without losing my train of thought many times over. I've had to drop all my classes this semester because it felt like my brain had been replaced with a pile of pudding. 

So although I'm literally starting medication today, I'm worried I might end up with those particular side effects and want to take preventative measures. (Summer classes also start soon, ahhhh!). I read that some people take folic acid? Are there any other supplements, mental exercises, etc, you all could recommend? Or was an auxiliary medication the solution? 

Any advice is appreciated. This is all incredibly new to me so I'm a little overwhelmed. Thanks!",bipolar
"Can you get musical hallucinations when forgetting to take lithium? HELP. I have been diagnosed Bipolar 2 for a little over 2 years.  I first had musical hallucinations when I was on Lamicatal and Lithium.  I would hear them more often at night and ONLY when there was white noise (like AC or fan).  They were so vivid that some nights I accused my brother of playing his radio too loud (he was fast asleep) or others when I thought I heard the ice cream truck outside or a distant block party.  While on the Lamicatal and Lithium combo I also was suffering with some visual hallucinations as well (I thought I saw a man or I thought I saw things running across the floor in the corner of my eye)...the minute I went off of the Lamicital ALL hallucinations stopped.  

NOW 2 years later...I am on 750 depakote and 600mg (immediate release) Lithium 2x per day.  I have been on this combo for about 8 months...again no problems...best I have ever felt....EXCEPT occasionally and for no apparent reason I am getting the musical hallucinations back again.  NO other types of hallucinations, no voices.  It is only with white noise and it is just really annoying to be honest.  It isn't always the same type of music.  I am in different environments when it happens (not always at my house).  Tends to be more at night (but that is when there is white noise).  I try to track if it matches my mood, no connection.  Only thing I can think of is that recently I have been forgetting to take the AM dose of lithium but I ALWAYS take the night one.

I'm in the process of finding an apartment and moving out. But all I keep thinking is that I don't want to break up and I feel like a complete failure for not being able to control my moods. I asked him if he loves me and he said it's really hard to love you when you're manic. I feel like a complete failure. I know I need to leave him alone and move on but I just keep asking him to take me back. He says the way I treat him makes him know I don't love him. I just want to be NORMAL.

"OTC sleeping pills that don't make you feel groggy? I'm finding it impossible to sleep. I don't think it's mania triggered because my insomnia is exhausting. I think it's related to anxiety and depression. 

I usually take unisom to sleep and it helps a lot, but it makes me feel so groggy and it's harder than usual to wake up when I take it. I've been experimenting by alternating between taking it and not taking it, and I've found that unisom makes it impossible to feel refreshed in the morning. However, my insomnia also makes it hard for me to feel refreshed in the morning—but the grogginess is actually more tolerable and it's easier to wake up than when I sleep on unisom. 

Still, insomnia is incredibly boring. I don't know what to do when I'm awake all night. Plus my fiancé sleeps next to me and he's a really light sleeper who wakes up early for work, so I usually end up quietly looking at my phone all night. 

HAE tried over the counter sleeping pills that don't cause such intense grogginess and difficulty waking up? I'm not interested in prescription drugs like ambien, although I am considering asking my pdoc for trazadone. OTC would be cheaper and easier to get though. I'm on klonopin but that doesn't always work. I'm weirdly awake and functioning on klonopin. Not sleepy or zombie-like at all. 

Please recommend drugs you've tried that help. My meds (lamotrigine and lexapro) don't help me sleep either although I take them at night. ",bipolar

"diagnosed at 32 No Support System...just need to vent Hey guys, I'm hoping to just air out some things and maybe get some feedback. 
I'm a 32F single mom of 2 who had a dysfunctional upbringing (physical, emotional, sexual abuse etc). I always felt like something was wrong with me growing up but my problems were always second to every one else's in my home (my father was abusive and abandoned us after my parents divorced, sister ran away from home as a teenager in and out of foster homes, my brother got locked up at a young age and has spent his whole life in and out of jail). 

By comparison, I'm the ""good"" child because I graduated with honors and eventually went to college and got my Bachelor's degree. But I always struggled with depression and feeling empty like my life had no purpose. I made up for this by holding onto my religious faith (dad's a pastor mom is an evangelist go frickin figure).

It started when I was 18 and started feeling like being the good child got me nowhere so I started drinking and being promiscuous. By this time I'd already been molested so it was easy to not feel anything about what I was doing. Looking back on it now, I guess this was the first signs of my mania because I would do dangerous things and put myself in bad situations, which eventually led up to me getting pregnant with my first son. Me and his father did not get along during the pregnancy and I put my whole sense of self worth and purpose into raising my child. But after I had him, I changed myself again, became more popular started partying and went back to a self destructive way of living. After I randomly quit my job and fell on hard times, I packed up and moved out of state to start over. Take a guess how that went. Then came baby number 2 and I at least stopped having babies lol.
These cycles persisted, like every 3 years I get the itch, quit my job and make an impulsive decision and rationalize it only to end up having to rebuild my life over again. Because I've always had a strained relationship with my family I never felt like I was leaving anything behind. Over the years I started losing contact with friends and started seeing that the relationship with my family wasn't healthy. The last straw was in 2017. All 2016 I had warned the people in my life that I felt like I was always alone and wasn't getting what I needed in these relationships. I confronted my mom about how she constantly bashes me to people when she doesn't agree with me, then turns around and brags about how great I am when I'm in her good graces. It was very embarrassing knowing that if my mom and I argue she will call my son's father, coworkers from my job, or even childhood friends to badmouth me and make me out to be a bad mom. I won't even get on my sister, and my dad kicked me out of his house at 11 told me not to come to his funeral and then refused to see me for 17 years. When he finally came back he asked to be the man I hadn't had in my life...then ghosted me again and does not understand why I no longer want a relationship with him. 

I feel like my relationship with my family has tainted my view of others and I have a really hard time socializing or opening up because I'm so embarrassed about my upbringing and poor choices. So by 2017 I was really isolated.
I had finally worked up to a really good job but we got a new guy and he put something on my phone and laptop with a download link he texted me (I had my suspicions then found on my laptop where cortana the speech recognition software was sending out instructions to email another coworker that I was not close to at all. This was not a work laptop, but my work computer was connected to my house wifi so I guess that's how it happened). In hindsight I guess he thought it was funny but it made me SEVERELY paranoid to the point that I quit my job (I didnt file charges on him which I should have, I just felt really alone and wanted it all to go away)started an online business and officially went No Contact with family members. I changed my phone number and said I would move on with my life and I focused on self improvement. What ended up happening was I had a severe manic episode where I felt like someone was after me, packed up my kids and drove to a far away city where I filed a police report that my family and coworkers were conspiring against me.
 It took me a few days to calm down and realize I wasn't thinking straight. I reached out for help and when I told the doctor I went 3 days without sleeping I was diagnosed as Bipolar.

When I first got on meds it was okay, I needed the mellow because I ended up homeless in a shelter trying to find another job and mad at myself for how I handled things. So it was nice to finally not be reacting to every little thing happening in my life. Then I gained 30 lbs (I was obese in highschool and was proud of having maintained 50lb weight loss after 2 kids, so this was a huge blow to me) and at first the new obsession was on working out and getting rid of the weight. But I actually gained weight the more I dieted and worked out, so I just gave up. Now I don't feel motivated by anything. I distance myself from people, I ignore texts and calls to just lay in bed. I don't have the energy anymore to maintain my online business. Now that I don't have the mania anymore its making the lows feel like forever. It's hard for me to have the optimism I used to have about my future and its making me a lot less productive. Now I'm asking myself how much of me is actually me and what is just this chemical imbalance ive been dealing with for years. And I know I should be happy to get off this roller coaster ride but I just keep thinking about all the mistakes I made when I couldn't think straight. Anyway, I turn 33 in 9 days. I found another job, though it doesn't pay as well as the job I left. I have a home for me and my kids, although financially I'm going through it again. I haven't been consistent with my meds because of the weight gain and I'm back to crying at my desk at work again :( ",bipolar

"Anyone else ever feel like it's hard for them to distinguish mania or hypomania? I've gone to the doctors one time thinking I just had a mild hypomanic episode and she was like ""no, what you described sounds like full blown mania, you need medication."" Does anyone else ever feel like it's hard to tell sometimes? 
I don't know, when I was a kid and having episodes people thought I had hyper ADHD and I didn't know it was a problem I just felt my head spinning, didn't sleep, talked a lot, acted silly, and then got super angry and outraged. With my family I fee like I stuffed down the euphoria or somehow they just always ignited the blunt end of the stick and I would freak out on them and break stuff,  i would also be up all night and scream throughout the night with panic attacks and what I call ""irritable attacks"" I would also be extremely paranoid and think people were coming to kill my family (but I wouldn't say this because apart of me felt crazy and I felt as honestly petrified at what was happening to me). So from other experiences I've heard and textbook that sounds like mania(I also have more things that would fit mania or hypomania). Still though why is it so hard for me to understand the manic inside me? 
I definitely lean towards the irritable side of it and have more irritable, mixed, and depressive episodes than the ""happy"" stuff. Sometimes I think i just convince myself I don't have bipolar or that it's just ""normal"" even though I'm a basket case. I almost feel like though in our society saying you have mental illness has become trendy and the seriousness and complexity of mental illness is down played or there's always that person who's like ""I get like that too sometimes"" when they clearly don't get what it's like to the extent you do. So I kind of almost try to convince myself I'm like the rest of society that's just being over dramatic about it, but maybe I don't realize how serious it is for me until the shit hits the fan as hard as it can for me.",bipolar

I feel like this illness can be truly cruel. At times you have everything you could ever want and feel like there is literally nothing you can't do. On top of the world ready to live life to the fullest in every possible way; nothings stopping you. A feeling that is irresistibly seductive and intoxicating. 

To give this feeling to someone and then take it away and replace it with its 'polar' opposite is cruel. The weight of the world, at times, is holding you down, stress is unbearable and a mere will to live can be hard to muster. Motivation and everything you care about is no longer that important.

I find it hard to believe in a higher power or ""God"" against the wishes of my parents and some friends.

"maintaining a healthy relationship- is it even possible? first time posting- 
so here it goes- sorry if this should go into a relationship subreddit- but i really feel like this has to do more with my bipolar and want some insights from a community from like minded supportive individuals....that won't call me ""crazy"" or whatever....
i've been in therapy for years working on my bipolar/childhood trauma/abandonment issues/eating disorder all that jazz...i have a lot of issues when it comes to being able to maintain a healthy relationship when it comes to keeping my moods in check. 
i was with someone for a very very long time- at the end we ended things for multiple reasons, some of them being my mental state and the act that they couldn't ""save me"". and that it was too sad for them, and that i was far too damaged. any relationships I've had after that have come to the same thing- i/m too damaged and no-one can handle my mood swings. they like me when I'm in my highs but they can't handle the depressions and the lows. i get it. i wouldn't want to handle me either. i know i am deserving of love- i feel like we all are, i have a lot of love and compassion to give. when i love i love hard, i just don't hold a lot of love for myself. i tend to be self destructive and can't accept that someone can love me in return.
so what I'm facing now is that:
i found someone. someone I'm head over heels for.. that i see a future with, that i think the world of...and I'm ruining every single aspect of it.
 when we first started dating, i felt in control, that i had the upper hand. i was on top of the world. i was confident and secure. then suddenly. i realized i had all these feelings. feelings i haven't had in a very very long time, mostly because i shut myself off from ever having feelings for anyone again to protect myself. (since being hurt is a huge trigger for me) now that i am in a relationship with this person, that i think the world of, i am projecting every insecurity imaginable, and i can't seem to stop.like every little thing- things that don't matter at all are somehow getting onto my head and becoming a thing-  i am spiraling out of control and i being completely self destructive and pushing him away. and it sucks. i want to be with this person very much, I'm very happy, and i like who i am with this person. but my brain is playing all these horrible tricks on me. and it will not let  up. the more i try to explain what is going on, the more i mess everything up- to the point that my partner feels like they can't even talk to me without me getting upset and furthering the spiral. I've been very open about my bipolar from the beginning and he is being very supportive and understanding- but i know its only a matter of time before i become too much. before my bipolar wins and i scare them away like i always do. I'm too much to handle. the  harder i fall- the more i love the more my brain acts out and wants to destroy. 
am i too damaged to be able to maintain a healthy relationship? 
how do i even begin to fix the damage I've already caused? he's told me that he's getting fed up with my insecurities, and that I'm doing a really good job of pushing him away....i appreciate his honesty- but i really feel so lost, i don't know how to even begin to move past this- or repair it- as my brain is overactive. has anyone else been through this? has anyone been able to maintain/fix a relationship? I'm really feeling like I'm too old to be acting like this - its embarrassing.

"Watching IT tonight made me realize something How hard and scary is for me facing my fears. Kids are afraid of monsters; they can be punched in the nose. But adults are afraid of situations, ideas, abstractions. There's no way to make it concrete and just punch them.
I am depressed. And I feel weaker to face my fears. And guilty for not doing it.
Pennywise for me is low self-esteem, a crap self image, and a desperate wish of getting back to past and make my whole life different. 


I want to cry so bad, but I can't, because I would worry my mom, who is taking care of me in this depressive phase. I am so fragile tonight. I hope that next days I can feel better.

"What if I have no ""normal""? Is it possible to be dysthymic (persistent low grade depression that doesn't severely unpair function) when I'm not having a severe depressive or hypo/manic episode?

I know that there's no hard and fast way to gauge mental condition because we can't perfectly categorize and quantify all the mishmash of processes going on in the brain yet, but I was always told that dysthymia was ""incompatible"" with bipolar.

But I (and others around me) notice just a consistent depressive quality in my ""normal"" state. I'm quiet, anxious, slightly irritable on a daily basis punctuated with severe depressive episodes and hypomanic/manic episodes (maybe mixed since I'm so confused?) episodes.

Am I incorrect on believing I'm also dysthymic? I feel like there's no ""normal"" for me. If normal is a 0 on a graph, I'm consistently functioning at a -5 and that's my ""normal"".

Anyone share any similar experiences?",bipolar
"Tremor/Shaking with no med changes So the last n weeks have been a rollercoaster, a few days ago people told me I was yet again displaying signs of mania (and sleep was also getting bad). I normally take 200mg of Seroquel for sleep but I had been authorized for up to 400mg. Since 200mg hadn't worked the night before I took 400, and while I managed to fall asleep I was wide awake an hour later, so I took another 200 totalling 600 (which resulted in shitty on and off sleep). That is the only med change I have made.

Besides that I have been feeling a lot calmer and in control yesterday and today (and last night I only took 400 and managed to sleep all night), and people have even pointed out my speech has slowed down and that I am acting rationally.

However I am still having trouble eating. I am also exercising intensely again. I don't feel anxious but I have noticed a tremor in my hands today and shaking yesterday.

Has anyone experienced this?

Again my only med change was two nights ago I took 200 more mg of Seroquel than I had been authorized/been using before.

Edit: managed to eat a full, calorie rich food, with protein and fats and complex carbs. Tremor has noticeably decreased. ",bipolar

"Aripiprazole side effects? I was diagnosed with bipolar II recently (Friday the 13th for extra irony I guess) and the psychiatrist prescribed me 5mg of aripiprazole and .5 mg of benztropine for the jitters/restlessness that aripiprazole can cause.

This Monday was the day I started taking it.  I felt a little sick on Monday and for about half of Tuesday, but after that is was fine and I felt really good, like I was actually me again.

Unfortunately, yesterday I started having what may or may not be side effects.  I'm having difficulty swallowing solid food (liquids are fine) and my vision is a little blurry (admittedly that's possibly because I haven't changed my contacts in a hot minute).  I called the psychiatrist and she instructed me to take only half the dose for ten days, then go back to full dose.

Has anyone else had similar symptoms?  What was your experience?  Did it go away on its own?",bipolar
"Advice wanted Not sure if this is allowed here but I'm hoping you guys can help!

I have a friend who is bipolar and I'm a bit worried about her recent behaviour. A couple of years ago she spiralled down into a depression and I could see it was happening but I didn't know what to do and assumed that her husband would be supporting her. I tried to be there for her which was pretty difficult at times and it was a tough period for all of them. Once she came out of it she opened up to me and we agreed that I would tell her if I thought it was happening again. The signs aren't the same this time but she is all over social media - one minute boasting about their new purchases (Gucci bags, very expensive cars etc) and how much she loves her husband and kids, the next minute posting about how people should think of others and stop showing off everything they have, and then she'll be slagging off her kids and calling out her husband for being useless etc. It looks like she's trying to overcompensate for something that's going on and her husbands way of dealing with it is to buy her expensive stuff - which we all know doesn't solve anything!

Should I say something? And if so how can I broach the subject in a supportive way without sounding like I'm just criticising her?

"Why I needed a god complex I figured out why I had to experience a grandiose delusion for 2-3yrs. I learned at an early age to separate from the part(s) of me that had unmet emotional needs and to turn the inner spotlight from me to everyone else. Around 8 I started losing sense of my own existence. I knew I was a physical being, but I stopped seeing myself as I saw others. I used to wish I was never born so I would be just as unreal as I felt. 

Eventually I needed a reason to exist, as another part of me splintered off to take charge and make sure I was doing something positive with my life. That person became obsessed with helping others and fixing injustices. Eventually I was convinced I was a deity of God sent here to reduce world suffering and mend country relationships. My personal life didn't matter because I'm here on mission for god. I needed motivation to get from day to day without having to give my personal life any value. 

I have always been against marriage, and frankly any close long term committed relationship. I wanted my mission to be my partner, and I'd have some casual committed relationships on the side. I didn't want to respect my personal needs or add to my personal life. I just wanted to focus on my mission, do the things, then die. Often the mission felt like an agonizing obligation because I was depressed and just wanted my existence to disappear. 

So that's why I needed the delusion. I needed motivation to fight on my victim self's behalf to fight injustice, but while still maintaining the idea that my life was not for personal enjoyment. ",bipolar
"That time I told my mum I thought I could have bipolar disorder This was a pretty huge moment for me. This was the first time I ever opened up to my mum about any of my feelings and I was only able to do it through the help of my friends mum who was supporting me. 

At this point I'd been suspicious of bipolar for about a year. I'd obviously watched my moods quite closely and done a lot of research. Since my mum is a doctor I was hoping she'd have some insight or at least be able to help me find some help. 

So I told her I'd been having these intense mood swings and that I was worried I could have some kind of bipolar disorder. She just looked at me and told me I read too much, that there was nothing wrong with me and that my hypomanic episodes were just me normally because I'm a motivated person and that I was depressed because I took too many drugs. 

Okay, because normal people go (in the space of hours) from suicidial depression to buying 10 books at a time, staying up all night studying, exercising 10 hours a week, picking up 5 new hobbies, and then stopping all of that 3 weeks later. Never mind the long and concerning mental health history that runs down my dads side of the family.

I don't even know where I'm going with this but it just annoys me that i mustered up all that courage to tell her and she cut me down like it was nothing. She didn't even offer to look into it further or try to find proper help. She didn't even know what symptoms I had beyond mood swings. She only sees the worst week of a depressive episode because I can't get out of bed and when I inevitably leap out of bed into the hypomanic episode which always follows, she just says it's good to see I'm better. Better??? I don't call that better. 

I honestly believed her so I stopped seeing the other doctor and figured I'd just cut out drugs and things would be fine. 4 months clean and I recently had my most intense hypomanic episode yet and didn't even realise until a month after the fact as I slept and ate all day in a deep depression. 

Don't expect anything, just wanted to vent.

"My son has given up He's done trying. He's over caring. We've been dealing with this since he was in elementary school, he'll be 19 in one week. He won't tell me his plans because last time I found out I had him admitted. That was 1 1/2 months ago. So now what? I can't force him to keep fighting. I can't convince him to not give up before he's exhausted all the help out there (med changes/therapy/etc). Am I supposed to just wait around for my son to die? What can I do? ",bipolar

"I am a Bad Scientist (or; 'When Repeatability is Morally OK But Probably Terrible: An Exploration of pharmaceutical benefits') Hypothesis: The medications are working at least a little.

**EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE*    
Step one: Be me

Step Two: Eat up a whole week's worth of pills in a manner consistent with a patient proactively working on managing chronic and acute mental health conditions

Step Three: Forget to refill pill minder

Step Four: Interrupt morning routine. Forget morning pills

Step Five: Interrupt evening routine. Forget evening pills

Step Six: Lay fitfully awake in bed for three to four hours recounting every embarrassing moment in high school plus that time when shooting a pregnant woman would have been legally justified.

Step Seven: Drink coffee while staring at empty pill minder, chiding self.

CONCLUSION: Yes, the pills are working a better than expected. Insomnia is being well-managed with current regimen of medications and supplements.
